You create a healing elixir in a simple vial that appears in your hand. The elixir retains its potency for the duration or until itâ€™s consumed, at which point the vial vanishes.

As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature. The drinker regains 2d4 + 2 hit points.
