As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you deal an additional 1d6 damage for each slot level above 1st.
