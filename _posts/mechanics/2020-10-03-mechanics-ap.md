Typically in Dungeons and Dragons, a DM will award Inspiration to a player based on certain positive actions the player conducts during a session. These actions are subjective from one DM to another (for example, a player could be awarded Inspiration for feeding a three-legged dog). Only one could be stored, however it gave the player the ability to re-roll at any point.

**Action Points (AP)** are an alternative to Inspiration that aims to put more power in the player's corner. AP can be used both defensively to boost rolls, as well as offensively to weaken the effect of an opponent. Players are given incentive to play as a team, take risks, and roleplay more extensively than what would be seen with a simple Inspiration system.

## Ways to Earn AP

- Each session, the table starts with twice the number of players in AP. AP is then divided into a Player pool and DM pool. **AP resets at the start of the next session, *so don't be afraid to spend it!***
- Outside of combat, Five (5) Loremaster Tokens (LT) can be converted into one (1) AP. This point is in circulation until the end of the current session.

## Ways to Spend AP

AP can be expended at any point before the DM resolves the outcome of the roll. Whenever AP is spent, it is first removed from the pool of origin, then added or 'flipped' to the opposite pool after the roll has been resolved. For example, when a player bolsters their roll using 2 AP, the DM gains 2 AP to use on any roll *after*. 

- Players and the DM can choose to expend one (1) or more AP to add 1d6 to an attack roll, damage roll, saving throw, or skill check. 
  - A creature cannot spend more AP than their proficiency bonus on a single roll. 
  - Critical hits can occur if ***the raw roll + the AP bonus*** is greater than or equal to 20. 
  - **ANTI-ADVERSARY CLAUSE:** Both sides of a roll will be given one opportunity (or response) to spend AP. 
    - For example, if a player decides to spend an AP on an attack roll they are making, the DM can choose to spend an AP in response for either the player's attack roll or the following damage roll, if successful. Afterwards, the player cannot use another AP in response to add onto the resulting damage roll.
    - The purpose of this clause is to prevent adversarial conflict between player and DM, such that either side decides to tack on AP to 'cancel' out effects in response chains. AP is meant to narratively and mechanically bolster the player and create an environment where luck, destiny, or whatever power you determine guides creatures prevails. 
- Players can choose to expend one (1) or more AP in place of an ephemeral toll (ET) requirement for an ability.
- Players can choose to expend one (1) AP in order to reverse the effect of a failed death saving throw. This reversal is considered a successful death saving throw. 
- Players and the DM can choose to expend two (2) or more (in multiples of two) AP in order to subtract 1d6 from an attack roll, damage roll, saving throw, or skill check. 
  - Non-damage rolls cannot be reduced beyond a 1. 
  - Damage rolls cannot be reduced beyond 0 hit points.
