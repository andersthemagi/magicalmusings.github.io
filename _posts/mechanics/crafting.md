# Crafting with Tools and Supplies

## Alchemist's Supplies 

Pulled from ['Alchemist's Supplies - v 1.1' by DumpStatAdventures'](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LOLaonp4U_qnvw02scm)

Alchemical items include magical medicines, potions, poisons, and concoctions made from not only plants, but caustic chemicals, acids, and what some might consider dangerous or illegal substances. 

### What's in the Toolkit?

Alchemist's supplies contain a variety of instruments such as vials, burners, flasks, and other components needed to pursue alchemy. Your tools weight about 8 lbs and cost 50 gp. Proficiency with these supplies allows you to add your profiency bonus to any Intelligence check you make in regards to alchemical concoctions. 

### Crafting Alchemical Items 

To craft an alchemical item, you must have proficiency in the use of alchemist's supplies and you must know the recipe for the item you wish to craft. After choosing the item to craft, you then must gather the required ingredients and begin crafting the item.

Alchemical items come in three qualities: Minor, Moderate, and Masterwork. Generally, the higher the quality, the more potent the item. Alchemical items do not lose their potency unless they are purposely mixed with other ingredients like water. Many alchemical items and recipes may be purchased from local alchemists, but as these items may take a while to produce, they could be very expensive when purchasing.

#### Alchemy Recipes

If you know the recipe for a particular item, you know which ingredients are required to craft it, where those ingredients are likely to be found, and how to prepare them. You may even know enough to substitute ingredients based on what's available locally. 

Every alchemy recipe specifies the DCs required to craft Minor, Moderate, and Masterwork quality versions of that item. It also specifies any unique items you must have in order to craft. These ingredients may need to be acquired via special means, such as purchase or during the course of an adventure. 

#### Crafting the Item

Once you have gathered the appropriate materials, it generally takes several hours to craft the item and you need a afe place to conduct these experiments. After the set amount of time has passed to create the item, you roll an Intelligence (Alchemist's Supplies) check and consult the DCs of the item you created. The higher the result, the more potent the item will typically be. A general rule of thumb for implementing new recipes can be found below as a reference point. 

|Rarity|Minor DC|Moderate DC|Masterwork DC|Time|
|:-----|:------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:--:|
|Common|8|10|13|4 hours|
|Uncommon|10|13|15|8 hours|
|Rare|13|15|18|16 hours|
|Very Rare|15|18|20|24+ hours|

The effects as listed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* are assumed to be the Masterwork versions of those items, lower qualities tend to provide less benefits either through functioning for less time or providing a lower bonus. 

##### Timing 

Sometimes you can leave the item alone after the initial set up, however certain items may require constant tending to and could end up being useless if left unattended. If an item requires **constant attention**, then you must be able to check in on and work on your alchemical item multiple times every hour. Otherwise, all that's required is the initial setup and you can come back after a set number of hours. 

Liquids and potions *typically* require little to no attention, unless working with dangerous substances. Solids and powders require constant attention while crafting. 

##### Combining / Diluting Items

If you would like to have masterwork items by combining lower quality ingredients, you can spend a short rest combining lower quality items to form items of higher quality. It takes 2 minor items to create 1 moderate item, and 2 moderate items to produce 1 masterwork item.

Alternatively, you may wish to dilute items into a lower potency. It takes 2 masterwork items to create 3 moderate items, or 2 moderate items to dilute into 3 minor items. Dilution is much more than simply separating potions into individual bottles, and the process of dilution with alchemical concoctions rarely breaks even. 

### Learning New Recipes

If you are proficient with the alchemical supplies, there are a number of ways you can learn new recipes.
* An fellow alchemist can easily teach you a recipe they know, taking the amount of time needed to craft the recipe to teach you.
* You can discover an alchemist's notes, and spend the amount of time needed to craft the recipe learning by following along.

In addition, if you acquire an alchemical item, you can attempt to use your knowledge of alchemical supplies to analyze the item. It takes one hour of quiet, careful work to analyze an alchemical item. Roll an Intelligence (Alchemist's Supplies) check at the end of the work period. If you meet or exceed the Masterwork DC to craft the item, you learn the recipe. Otherwise, you learn nothing and the item is destroyed. Additionally, being interrupted during the process will also destroy the item. 

|Item|Crafting Time|Cost|
|:---|:-----------:|:--:|
|Acid|8 hrs.|15 gp|
|Alchemist's Fire|8 hrs.|25 gp|
|Assassin's Blood|24 hrs.|75 gp|
|Detect Magic Smelling Salts|4 hrs.|10 gp|
|Potion of Healing|8 hrs.|25 gp|
|Smoke Powder|4 hrs.|10 gp|
|Smokestick|8 hrs.|25 gp|
|Thunderstone|4 hrs.|30 gp|
|Truth Serum|3 days|100 gp|

### List of Recipes 

An new alchemist, or someone who has just recently learned how to use a set, typically knows three recipes. From there, they must find more recipes or experiment with found alchemical items.

One of the hardest things for a practicing alchemist to get right, and to get it strong enough to work. Its also only for alchemists that have coin to spare, as the cost of such a thing is high. Mixed with the crushed seeds of a flower that grows in certain tropics, it goes through months of processing until it's outer coating dissolves and the delicate oils are able to be harvested.

## Brewer's Supplies

Pulled from ['Brewer Supplies - v1.1' by DumpStatAdventures](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LbudMyCoMbx7gMM_Te6)

Beer has been around for almost as long as bread has, and one could argue that it has a greater effect on society, at least in the evening. This favorite drink is created by steeping cereal grains in water and letting that ferment into a sweet flavored beverage with yeast. The yeast, grains, and adjuncts help define the drink and its complicated flavoring, and it also allows you to add in alchemical and magical ingredients to help give your drinks a better punch.

While it typically takes Beer, Ale, Lagers and so many other drinks weeks or even months to fully develop; with these small batch drinks you'll be up and drinking in a few days!

### What's in the Toolkit?

Brewer's Supplies include a mash tun, copper kettle, piping, a siphon, a series of mesh filters, a small fermenting vat, and basic malt, hops and spices. These supplies cost 30 gp and weigh 50 lbs. Proficiency with Brewer's Supplies allows you to add your Proficiency Bonus to any check you make for brewing or identifing alcohols.

### How to Brew

When brewing an item, you must know its recipe, have access to the requisite materials, and spend the amount of days needed for it to process and ferment. Anytime a check is called for in brewing this beverage, you must make a Wisdom check, and if you are proficient in Brewer's Supplies, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

#### Recipe Brews

Every brewed beverage requires a recipe to make. This recipe lists out any special ingredients you need, the number of days required to ferment, and the difficulty of the beverage. Some special ingredients may require you to purchase them in town, or to go on quests to find them.

You can learn new recipes by visiting other brewers, travelers or in faraway monasteries that guard their specialty recipes. You can also make a Brewer's Supplies check if you encounter a brewed beverage and you want to determine how you could craft it yourself.

You can only have one recipe brewing at a time in your fermenting vat. To brew more, you must purchase another Brewer's Supplies. Each brew is enough to create one use, or one bottle, of that recipe. If you wish to create in bulk, that would be up to the DM's discretion and require proper equipment like a brewery.

#### The Process

To create a brewed beverage, you must first gather the required ingredients for a recipe that you know. After that you then create your mash and then ferment the mixture for a number of days, based on the recipe. You must succeed on two Wisdom (Brewer's Supplies) checks in order to properly brew a beverage of your choice.

##### Boiling the Mash

Once you gather your ingredients, you can begin creating and boiling the mash over the course of a short or long rest. Once your grains and spices are properly prepared, you must then make a Wisdom (Brewer's Supplies) check, the DC is determined by the recipe, in order to properly prepare the mash. On a fail, you can still brew your beverage but it will not have any Effects.

##### Fermenting the Brew

After preparing the mash, you then must filter it out and then add it to your special fermenting vat, a slightly larger sized sealed flagon that you can strap to the outside of a travel pack. After a certain number of days, determined by the recipe, your brew will finish fermenting.

Once your brew is fermented, you must make a Wisdom (Brewer's Supplies) check based off of the DC of the recipe you are attempting, on a fail the fermented brew does not have any Effects.

#### Imbibing

While your brewed goods do have alcohol, you don't need to worry about intoxication unless the DM decides that the character has had too much to drink. A character can only benefit from a single Brewed Beverage once per short rest, upon drinking additional brews, they gain no additional benefits from the second beverage and lose any benefits of the original beverage.

If your brew isn't consumed immediately, you can bottle your brew for a later use. Each bottled brew weighs half a pound and can last for several months before its no longer fit to be drunk.

If you wish to buy these, you may be able to find them sold at specialty breweries, their costs can range from **two to ten times their Ingredient costs.**

Shaping and forming wood, you can carve wood and morph it into shapes useful for not only combat but art as well.

### What's in the Toolkit?

Woodcarver's tools consist of a carving knife, a gouge, a small mallet, and a small saw. Your tools weigh 5 lbs and cost 2gp.

#### Woodcarving 

Carving wood into beautiful art or deadly weapons requires that you have materials present, because your expertise and tools are designed for wood, you must have wood handy.There are some types of wood, like hardwoods or magically enhanced wood, that might be more difficult to craft or have special properties you can impart into your projects.

When carving, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) check, and you can add your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with said tools. 

### Creating your Project 

Woodcarving can be a very short process if you are crafting a simple statue that fits in your palm or it can be a week long endeavor to create beautiful designs on a man-sized totem. To carve wood, you must spend at least 10 minutes, or more depending on the project. A small wooden figure of a horse may only take a skilled carver 10 minutes, while a throne fit for a king may require several weeks or months. Most simple projects require up to an hour to complete. The more elaborate the design, or the size required, the longer the piece takes to complete per the DM's discretion. Examples are given below. Carving wood can be defined into 2 broad categories: **detail** and **scope**.

#### Detail 

The detail of your carvings affects the length of time to complete your project. There are three categories for your projects: **Vague, Light,** or **Heavy** detail. All times represent the minimum for each project, and at the DM's discretion they might take longer. 

**Vaguely** detailed projects require at least 5 minutes to work an appropriately sized piece of wood plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. A vaguely detailed project might be a set of arrow shafts, a door wedge, or other basic shapes. *Vaguely detailed projects add a +1 to Carving DC*.

**Lightly** detailed projects require at least 1 hour plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. Lightly detailed projects generally consist of multiple basic shapes combined to create figurines, or slightly complicated designs. For example, you could create a figurine of a horse but not include any details like fur or hooves. *Lightly detailed projects add a +3 to Carving DC*.

**Heavily** detailed projects require at least 8 hours to carve plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. Heavily detailed projects consist of carved patterns or intricate shapes, such as feathers on a bird or adding the wrinkles on a wooden face. *Heavily detailed projects add a +6 to Carving DC*.

#### Scope 

The scope of the project affects the length in time to carve out the shape in wood. The scope represents the size of your creations and there are three categories: **Minute, Substantial,** or **Immense**. All times represent the minimum time to create projects of a certain scope, and at the DM's discretion may take longer. 

**Minute** projects require at least 5 minutes to carve plus the amount of time it requires for the detail of the project. A project of this scope is something small enough to fit or be handled easily with a single hand. This includes things like figurines, arrow shafts, or objects that weigh below 2 lbs. Minute 

**Substantial** projects require at least 1 hour plus the amount of time it requires for the detail of the project. A substantial project is something relatively large-sized that can easily be handled with two hands. Examples might include a shield, quarterstaff, or objects that weigh below 30 lbs. 

**Immense** projects require at least 8 hours to create plus the amount of time required for the detail of the project. An immense project could be a throne, a pulpit, a wooden wall or anything that requires a lot of effort or multiple people to move about. 

#### Creating the Project 

After the project is completed, or 8 hours of work has been completed, the crafter must succeed on a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) check. On a success, they make progress on their creation or finish it depending on detail and scope. On a fail of 10 or less, they make no progress. On a fail of 11 or more, they have broken or damaged the project in such a way as to decrease its value. Restarting the project may be necessary at that point. 

The DC for carving a project is heavily dependent on the **detail** and **scope**. The DC for Carving is:
<p align = "center">
  <b>Carving DC:</b> <i>8 + Detail Bonus + Scope Bonus</i>
</p>
The DM may decide that certain details or sizes may raise or lower the DC, or adjust how often or little you need to roll to make progress. If you are creating a heavily detailed and immense throne, making a check every 8 hours may be too much left to chance. Ultimately, the number of checks required is simply a recommendation. Some example projects are included below:

|Project|Detail|Scope|Time|Carving DC|# of Checks|
|:------|:-----|:----|:--:|:--------:|:---------:|
|Arrow  |Vague |Minute|10 min.|10|1|
|Small Carving Board|Vague|Minute|10 min.|10|1|
|Figurine of a Horse|Light|Minute|1 hour|12|1|
|Quarterstaff|Light|Substantial|1 hr.|15|1|
|Shield|Light|Substantial|2 hrs.|15|1|
|Intricate Whistle|Heavy|Minute|8 hrs.|15|1|
|Throne for a Sprite|Heavy|Minute|8 hrs.|15|1|
|Owl Statue|Heavy|Substantial|9 hrs.|17|2|
|Temple Pulpit|Heavy|Immense|16+ hrs.|20|2+|

#### Limited Tools 

To make the tools easy to carry around on your travels, you have very few tools and may not be able to work on orojects of Immense scope. If you have access to a workshop with a full set of carving tools, the DM may decide to give you advantage on Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) checks or reduce the amount of time it takes to complete a project. 

### Searching for Materials 

Before you can begin a project, you must first acquire your materials. To create your project, you must find a suitable chunk of wood that is approximately the same size as the project you wish to create. You can always take wood away, but it is much harder to add additional wood to make a project larger.

Unless you have some other means of gathering your material, you must journey through forests searching for the right chunks to use for the project. A Nature check can be made to find materials, and the Material Search DC is dependent on the type of forests around you and the size of the project. A few examples are provided below:

|DC | Scope of Project | Density / Type of Forest |
|:-:|:-----------------------|:-----------------|
|5 |Minute     | Extremely dense, lots of trees         |
|8 |Minute     |Thinning Forest, mostly new growth      |
|10|Minute     |Forest dying to disease, mostly saplings|
|10|Substantial|Extremely dense, lots of trees          | 
|13|Substantial|Thinning forest, mostly new growth      |
|15|Substantial|Forest dying to disease, mostly saplings|
|15|Immense    |Extremely dense, lots of trees          |
|18|Immense    |Thinning forest, mostly new growth      |
|20|Immense    |Forest dying of disease, mostly saplings|

The quality of the forst and the scope of the project can make it very difficult to find the right size of wood needed for your creation. There is the potential you could **buy** the required chunk of wood in town with the following example prices provided.

|Type of Wood|Weight|Cost|
|:-----------|:----:|:--:|
|Softwood      |1 lb  |2 cp |
|Hardwood      |1 lb  |1 gp |
|Petrified Wood|1 lb  |3 gp |
|Dragon Burned |1 lb  |5 pp |

#### Softwood

Softwood is the typical wood used by most woodcarvers for their projects. It is cheap and easy to come by. It has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Softwood breeds include Birch, Fir, Teak, and Walnut.

#### Hardwood

Hardwood is a common type of wood that is harder than regular wood, making it ideal for long lasting design and weaponry. If a weapon is made out of hardwood, it deals +1 additional damage on a hit. It has an AC of 12 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. Hardwood breeds include Mahogany, Oak, and Pine. 

#### Petrified Wood

This wood has been petrified, either by a basilisk, or through a long process of fossilization. Due to how hard it is, it provides ample durability and additional force when used in weaponry. When you score a critical hit with a weapon made of this material, it deals one additional die of damage (applied AFTER the damage is doubled). It has an AC of 15 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Any breed of wood can become petrified.

#### Dragon Burned

When a forest is scoured by draconic breath, some trees are so enveloped in the blasts that aspects of the dragon's magic infuses the wood with that particular element. When used in weaponry, this magical wood allows the weapon to deal elemental damage instead of its normal damage type. It has an AC and hit points of its original breed, however it gains no other benefits.
