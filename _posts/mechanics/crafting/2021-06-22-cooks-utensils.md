Cook's utensils are used to prepare food for royals, adventurers, and anyone else that enjoys food for more than just sustenance. These delicious dishes are the calling cards of chef's and, through the love of their Signature Dishes, are imbued with a hint of magic.

## What's in the Toolkit?

Cook's Utensils include a metal pot, knives, forks, a stirring spoon, and a ladle. Proficiency with this kit allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any checks you make for your Signature Dishes.

## Cooking Signature Dishes

Signature Dishes are recipes you are known for and are so good, that the magic from the world has infused them with special properties. To cook a Signature Dish, you must have proficiency in the use of the Cook's Utensils and you must know the recipe for the item you wish to cook. After choosing the Signature Dish to cook, you must gather the required ingredients and then you can cook the dish. You must roll a Wisdom (Cook's Utensils) check, though certain recipes may call for you to use your Intelligence instead.

If you do not have proficiency, you can still cook the items, but you do not gain any of the effects of a Signature Dish except for good quality food.

### Signature Dish Recipes

If you know the recipe for a particular item, you know which ingredients are required to cook a Signature Dish, where those ingredients are likely to be found, and how to prepare them. You even know enough to substitute ingredients based on what’s available in your pantry.

Every Signature Dish recipe specifies the DCs required to craft Select, Choice, and Prime quality versions of that item. It also specifies any unique ingredients you must have access too, those ingredients must be acquired through special means, either through purchase or during the course of an adventure. When you roll a check to create food, you compare the result to each quality's DC and you create the highest quality of the item whose DC you met or exceeded.

### Cooking your Dish

Signature Dishes come in three qualities, starting with the lowest and increasing in quality: Select, Choice, and Prime. Generally, the higher the quality, the more potent the item. A dish you have just cooked is known as Fresh and has all of its normal benefits.

#### Cold

As time passes, Signature Dishes, just like other food, begins degrading in quality. This effect is known as becoming Cold. When a Signature Dish becomes Cold, based on the type of dish being created, they offer a reduced benefit and are not as effective as when first cooked (if at all).

#### Compost 

The final stage of a Signature Dish is when it gains the Compost trait. This means it is only fit for composting and has no benefits, though you can still eat it in a pinch. A Compost dish has spent too much time since it was created and so has lost any benefits the dish once had.

### Categories 

The three categories for Signature Dishes are:
* **Snacks** take 10 minutes to prepare and don't become Cold for several days.
* **Everyday** dishes can take a full hour to prepare and become Cold after a few hours.
* **Gourmet** can take several hours to prepare, and may even require constant monitoring while preparing it. These dishes become Cold quickly and should be consumed soon.

#### Fresh Ingredients

Signature Dishes are best prepared with ingredients of the finest quality that have the Fresh trait. The Fresh trait provides a small bonus to the dish, this typically makes the DC for creating the Signature Dishes lower, though it mayeven provide an extra lasting effect to the dish. When Fresh ingredients are unable to be used, the Signature Dishes have their default bonuses.

#### Enough for a Feast

When you make a Signature Dish, you create enough to feed up to 7 medium sized creatures and a creature can only gain the benefits of one of your Signature Dishes once per short rest. A creature loses any benefits from a previous Signature Dish, even if they have taken a short rest, if they consume another Signature Dish. Eating regular food does not lose any benefits early.

For each size category above medium, double the amount of food they need, for exmaple a Large creature takes the place of 2 creatures and a huge creature is 4 creatures. Small sized and smaller creatures take the place of 1 medium creature. If a creature doesn't eat enough of your Signature Dish, they gain no benefits. Eating more than is required provides no extra benefits.

## Learning New Recipes

If you are proficient with the Cook's Utensils, there are a number of ways you can learn new recipes. Chefs can easily teach each other recipes in just a few minutes and if you discover a chef's Recipe Book, you can also learn any recipes they have recorded. Not every recipe is a Signature Dish as Signature Dishes are special and often infused with magic upon their creation. Some say this is a blessing from the deity of food, but it could be the chef's own innate magical ability.

In addition, if you acquire a Signature Dish, you can use your Cook's Utensils to analyze the item. It takes one hour of quiet, careful work to analyze a Signature Dish and the item is destroyed in the process. At the end of the work period, make Wisdom (Cook's Utensils) check. If you meet or exceed the DC required to craft the item at Prime quality, you learn the recipe. Otherwise, you have learned nothing and destroyed the item.
