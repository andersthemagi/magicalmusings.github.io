Pulled from ['Alchemist's Supplies - v 1.1' by DumpStatAdventures'](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LOLaonp4U_qnvw02scm)

Alchemical items include magical medicines, potions, poisons, and concoctions made from not only plants, but caustic chemicals, acids, and what some might consider dangerous or illegal substances. 

## What's in the Toolkit?

Alchemist's supplies contain a variety of instruments such as vials, burners, flasks, and other components needed to pursue alchemy. Your tools weight about 8 lbs and cost 50 gp. Proficiency with these supplies allows you to add your profiency bonus to any Intelligence check you make in regards to alchemical concoctions. 

## Crafting Alchemical Items 

To craft an alchemical item, you must have proficiency in the use of alchemist's supplies and you must know the recipe for the item you wish to craft. After choosing the item to craft, you then must gather the required ingredients and begin crafting the item.

Alchemical items come in three qualities: Minor, Moderate, and Masterwork. Generally, the higher the quality, the more potent the item. Alchemical items do not lose their potency unless they are purposely mixed with other ingredients like water. Many alchemical items and recipes may be purchased from local alchemists, but as these items may take a while to produce, they could be very expensive when purchasing.

### Alchemy Recipes

If you know the recipe for a particular item, you know which ingredients are required to craft it, where those ingredients are likely to be found, and how to prepare them. You may even know enough to substitute ingredients based on what's available locally. 

Every alchemy recipe specifies the DCs required to craft Minor, Moderate, and Masterwork quality versions of that item. It also specifies any unique items you must have in order to craft. These ingredients may need to be acquired via special means, such as purchase or during the course of an adventure. 

### Crafting the Item

Once you have gathered the appropriate materials, it generally takes several hours to craft the item and you need a afe place to conduct these experiments. After the set amount of time has passed to create the item, you roll an Intelligence (Alchemist's Supplies) check and consult the DCs of the item you created. The higher the result, the more potent the item will typically be. A general rule of thumb for implementing new recipes can be found below as a reference point. 

|Rarity|Minor DC|Moderate DC|Masterwork DC|Time|
|:-----|:------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:--:|
|Common|8|10|13|4 hours|
|Uncommon|10|13|15|8 hours|
|Rare|13|15|18|16 hours|
|Very Rare|15|18|20|24+ hours|

The effects as listed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* are assumed to be the Masterwork versions of those items, lower qualities tend to provide less benefits either through functioning for less time or providing a lower bonus. 

#### Timing 

Sometimes you can leave the item alone after the initial set up, however certain items may require constant tending to and could end up being useless if left unattended. If an item requires **constant attention**, then you must be able to check in on and work on your alchemical item multiple times every hour. Otherwise, all that's required is the initial setup and you can come back after a set number of hours. 

Liquids and potions *typically* require little to no attention, unless working with dangerous substances. Solids and powders require constant attention while crafting. 

#### Combining / Diluting Items

If you would like to have masterwork items by combining lower quality ingredients, you can spend a short rest combining lower quality items to form items of higher quality. It takes 2 minor items to create 1 moderate item, and 2 moderate items to produce 1 masterwork item.

Alternatively, you may wish to dilute items into a lower potency. It takes 2 masterwork items to create 3 moderate items, or 2 moderate items to dilute into 3 minor items. Dilution is much more than simply separating potions into individual bottles, and the process of dilution with alchemical concoctions rarely breaks even. 

## Learning New Recipes

If you are proficient with the alchemical supplies, there are a number of ways you can learn new recipes.
* An fellow alchemist can easily teach you a recipe they know, taking the amount of time needed to craft the recipe to teach you.
* You can discover an alchemist's notes, and spend the amount of time needed to craft the recipe learning by following along.

In addition, if you acquire an alchemical item, you can attempt to use your knowledge of alchemical supplies to analyze the item. It takes one hour of quiet, careful work to analyze an alchemical item. Roll an Intelligence (Alchemist's Supplies) check at the end of the work period. If you meet or exceed the Masterwork DC to craft the item, you learn the recipe. Otherwise, you learn nothing and the item is destroyed. Additionally, being interrupted during the process will also destroy the item. 

|Item|Crafting Time|Cost|
|:---|:-----------:|:--:|
|Acid|8 hrs.|15 gp|
|Alchemist's Fire|8 hrs.|25 gp|
|Assassin's Blood|24 hrs.|75 gp|
|Detect Magic Smelling Salts|4 hrs.|10 gp|
|Potion of Healing|8 hrs.|25 gp|
|Smoke Powder|4 hrs.|10 gp|
|Smokestick|8 hrs.|25 gp|
|Thunderstone|4 hrs.|30 gp|
|Truth Serum|3 days|100 gp|

## List of Recipes 

An new alchemist, or someone who has just recently learned how to use a set, typically knows three recipes. From there, they must find more recipes or experiment with found alchemical items.

As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact.

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for a period of time based on the potency of the item.

### Truth Serum

One of the hardest things for a practicing alchemist to get right, and to get it strong enough to work. Its also only for alchemists that have coin to spare, as the cost of such a thing is high. Mixed with the crushed seeds of a flower that grows in certain tropics, it goes through months of processing until it's outer coating dissolves and the delicate oils are able to be harvested. When ingested, one is unable to speak a lie as if they are under the spell Zone of Truth. This takes 3 days to produce one vial, and you have to make the check at the end of every day.
