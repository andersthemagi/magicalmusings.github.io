Beer has been around for almost as long as bread has, and one could argue that it has a greater effect on society, at least in the evening. This favorite drink is created by steeping cereal grains in water and letting that ferment into a sweet flavored beverage with yeast. The yeast, grains, and adjuncts help define the drink and its complicated flavoring, and it also allows you to add in alchemical and magical ingredients to help give your drinks a better punch.

While it typically takes Beer, Ale, Lagers and so many other drinks weeks or even months to fully develop; with these small batch drinks you'll be up and drinking in a few days!

## What's in the Toolkit?

Brewer's Supplies include a mash tun, copper kettle, piping, a siphon, a series of mesh filters, a small fermenting vat, and basic malt, hops and spices. These supplies cost 30 gp and weigh 50 lbs. Proficiency with Brewer's Supplies allows you to add your Proficiency Bonus to any check you make for brewing or identifing alcohols.

## How to Brew

When brewing an item, you must know its recipe, have access to the requisite materials, and spend the amount of days needed for it to process and ferment. Anytime a check is called for in brewing this beverage, you must make a Wisdom check, and if you are proficient in Brewer's Supplies, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

### Recipe Brews

Every brewed beverage requires a recipe to make. This recipe lists out any special ingredients you need, the number of days required to ferment, and the difficulty of the beverage. Some special ingredients may require you to purchase them in town, or to go on quests to find them.

You can learn new recipes by visiting other brewers, travelers or in faraway monasteries that guard their specialty recipes. You can also make a Brewer's Supplies check if you encounter a brewed beverage and you want to determine how you could craft it yourself.

You can only have one recipe brewing at a time in your fermenting vat. To brew more, you must purchase another Brewer's Supplies. Each brew is enough to create one use, or one bottle, of that recipe. If you wish to create in bulk, that would be up to the DM's discretion and require proper equipment like a brewery.

### The Process

To create a brewed beverage, you must first gather the required ingredients for a recipe that you know. After that you then create your mash and then ferment the mixture for a number of days, based on the recipe. You must succeed on two Wisdom (Brewer's Supplies) checks in order to properly brew a beverage of your choice.

#### Boiling the Mash

Once you gather your ingredients, you can begin creating and boiling the mash over the course of a short or long rest. Once your grains and spices are properly prepared, you must then make a Wisdom (Brewer's Supplies) check, the DC is determined by the recipe, in order to properly prepare the mash. On a fail, you can still brew your beverage but it will not have any Effects.

#### Fermenting the Brew

After preparing the mash, you then must filter it out and then add it to your special fermenting vat, a slightly larger sized sealed flagon that you can strap to the outside of a travel pack. After a certain number of days, determined by the recipe, your brew will finish fermenting.

Once your brew is fermented, you must make a Wisdom (Brewer's Supplies) check based off of the DC of the recipe you are attempting, on a fail the fermented brew does not have any Effects.

### Imbibing

While your brewed goods do have alcohol, you don't need to worry about intoxication unless the DM decides that the character has had too much to drink. A character can only benefit from a single Brewed Beverage once per short rest, upon drinking additional brews, they gain no additional benefits from the second beverage and lose any benefits of the original beverage.

If your brew isn't consumed immediately, you can bottle your brew for a later use. Each bottled brew weighs half a pound and can last for several months before its no longer fit to be drunk.

If you wish to buy these, you may be able to find them sold at specialty breweries, their costs can range from **two to ten times their Ingredient costs.**
