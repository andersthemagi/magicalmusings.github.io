Shaping and forming wood, you can carve wood and morph it into shapes useful for not only combat but art as well.

## What's in the Toolkit?

Woodcarver's tools consist of a carving knife, a gouge, a small mallet, and a small saw. Your tools weigh 5 lbs and cost 2gp.

#### Woodcarving 

Carving wood into beautiful art or deadly weapons requires that you have materials present, because your expertise and tools are designed for wood, you must have wood handy.There are some types of wood, like hardwoods or magically enhanced wood, that might be more difficult to craft or have special properties you can impart into your projects.

When carving, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) check, and you can add your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with said tools. 

### Creating your Project 

Woodcarving can be a very short process if you are crafting a simple statue that fits in your palm or it can be a week long endeavor to create beautiful designs on a man-sized totem. To carve wood, you must spend at least 10 minutes, or more depending on the project. A small wooden figure of a horse may only take a skilled carver 10 minutes, while a throne fit for a king may require several weeks or months. Most simple projects require up to an hour to complete. The more elaborate the design, or the size required, the longer the piece takes to complete per the DM's discretion. Examples are given below. Carving wood can be defined into 2 broad categories: **detail** and **scope**.

#### Detail 

The detail of your carvings affects the length of time to complete your project. There are three categories for your projects: **Vague, Light,** or **Heavy** detail. All times represent the minimum for each project, and at the DM's discretion they might take longer. 

**Vaguely** detailed projects require at least 5 minutes to work an appropriately sized piece of wood plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. A vaguely detailed project might be a set of arrow shafts, a door wedge, or other basic shapes. *Vaguely detailed projects add a +1 to Carving DC*.

**Lightly** detailed projects require at least 1 hour plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. Lightly detailed projects generally consist of multiple basic shapes combined to create figurines, or slightly complicated designs. For example, you could create a figurine of a horse but not include any details like fur or hooves. *Lightly detailed projects add a +3 to Carving DC*.

**Heavily** detailed projects require at least 8 hours to carve plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. Heavily detailed projects consist of carved patterns or intricate shapes, such as feathers on a bird or adding the wrinkles on a wooden face. *Heavily detailed projects add a +6 to Carving DC*.

#### Scope 

The scope of the project affects the length in time to carve out the shape in wood. The scope represents the size of your creations and there are three categories: **Minute, Substantial,** or **Immense**. All times represent the minimum time to create projects of a certain scope, and at the DM's discretion may take longer. 

**Minute** projects require at least 5 minutes to carve plus the amount of time it requires for the detail of the project. A project of this scope is something small enough to fit or be handled easily with a single hand. This includes things like figurines, arrow shafts, or objects that weigh below 2 lbs. Minute 

**Substantial** projects require at least 1 hour plus the amount of time it requires for the detail of the project. A substantial project is something relatively large-sized that can easily be handled with two hands. Examples might include a shield, quarterstaff, or objects that weigh below 30 lbs. 

**Immense** projects require at least 8 hours to create plus the amount of time required for the detail of the project. An immense project could be a throne, a pulpit, a wooden wall or anything that requires a lot of effort or multiple people to move about. 

#### Creating the Project 

After the project is completed, or 8 hours of work has been completed, the crafter must succeed on a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) check. On a success, they make progress on their creation or finish it depending on detail and scope. On a fail of 10 or less, they make no progress. On a fail of 11 or more, they have broken or damaged the project in such a way as to decrease its value. Restarting the project may be necessary at that point. 

The DC for carving a project is heavily dependent on the **detail** and **scope**. The DC for Carving is:
<p align = "center">
  <b>Carving DC:</b> <i>8 + Detail Bonus + Scope Bonus</i>
</p>
The DM may decide that certain details or sizes may raise or lower the DC, or adjust how often or little you need to roll to make progress. If you are creating a heavily detailed and immense throne, making a check every 8 hours may be too much left to chance. Ultimately, the number of checks required is simply a recommendation. Some example projects are included below:

|Project|Detail|Scope|Time|Carving DC|# of Checks|
|:------|:-----|:----|:--:|:--------:|:---------:|
|Arrow  |Vague |Minute|10 min.|10|1|
|Small Carving Board|Vague|Minute|10 min.|10|1|
|Figurine of a Horse|Light|Minute|1 hour|12|1|
|Quarterstaff|Light|Substantial|1 hr.|15|1|
|Shield|Light|Substantial|2 hrs.|15|1|
|Intricate Whistle|Heavy|Minute|8 hrs.|15|1|
|Throne for a Sprite|Heavy|Minute|8 hrs.|15|1|
|Owl Statue|Heavy|Substantial|9 hrs.|17|2|
|Temple Pulpit|Heavy|Immense|16+ hrs.|20|2+|

#### Limited Tools 

To make the tools easy to carry around on your travels, you have very few tools and may not be able to work on orojects of Immense scope. If you have access to a workshop with a full set of carving tools, the DM may decide to give you advantage on Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) checks or reduce the amount of time it takes to complete a project. 

### Searching for Materials 

Before you can begin a project, you must first acquire your materials. To create your project, you must find a suitable chunk of wood that is approximately the same size as the project you wish to create. You can always take wood away, but it is much harder to add additional wood to make a project larger.

Unless you have some other means of gathering your material, you must journey through forests searching for the right chunks to use for the project. A Nature check can be made to find materials, and the Material Search DC is dependent on the type of forests around you and the size of the project. A few examples are provided below:

|DC | Scope of Project | Density / Type of Forest |
|:-:|:-----------------------|:-----------------|
|5 |Minute     | Extremely dense, lots of trees         |
|8 |Minute     |Thinning Forest, mostly new growth      |
|10|Minute     |Forest dying to disease, mostly saplings|
|10|Substantial|Extremely dense, lots of trees          | 
|13|Substantial|Thinning forest, mostly new growth      |
|15|Substantial|Forest dying to disease, mostly saplings|
|15|Immense    |Extremely dense, lots of trees          |
|18|Immense    |Thinning forest, mostly new growth      |
|20|Immense    |Forest dying of disease, mostly saplings|

The quality of the forst and the scope of the project can make it very difficult to find the right size of wood needed for your creation. There is the potential you could **buy** the required chunk of wood in town with the following example prices provided.

|Type of Wood|Weight|Cost|
|:-----------|:----:|:--:|
|Softwood      |1 lb  |2 cp |
|Hardwood      |1 lb  |1 gp |
|Petrified Wood|1 lb  |3 gp |
|Dragon Burned |1 lb  |5 pp |

#### Softwood

Softwood is the typical wood used by most woodcarvers for their projects. It is cheap and easy to come by. It has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Softwood breeds include Birch, Fir, Teak, and Walnut.

#### Hardwood

Hardwood is a common type of wood that is harder than regular wood, making it ideal for long lasting design and weaponry. If a weapon is made out of hardwood, it deals +1 additional damage on a hit. It has an AC of 12 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. Hardwood breeds include Mahogany, Oak, and Pine. 

#### Petrified Wood

This wood has been petrified, either by a basilisk, or through a long process of fossilization. Due to how hard it is, it provides ample durability and additional force when used in weaponry. When you score a critical hit with a weapon made of this material, it deals one additional die of damage (applied AFTER the damage is doubled). It has an AC of 15 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Any breed of wood can become petrified.

#### Dragon Burned

When a forest is scoured by draconic breath, some trees are so enveloped in the blasts that aspects of the dragon's magic infuses the wood with that particular element. When used in weaponry, this magical wood allows the weapon to deal elemental damage instead of its normal damage type. It has an AC and hit points of its original breed, however it gains no other benefits.
