From crafting exquisite dresses to shoddy garments meant to fool guards, you can weave cloth and thread together to produce jaw dropping gowns... or just repair broken seam on a backpack.

## What's in the Toolkit?

Weaver's tools include thread, needles, and scraps of cloth. You know how to work a loom, but such equipment is too large to transport.Weaver's Tools weigh 5 lbs and cost 1 gp.

## Sewing and Stitching 

Creating clothes and weaving fabrics, you know the value of sturdy traveling clothes, the importance of a dashing jacket or the importance of sparkling fabrics.

To craft your clothes, you must spend at least 4 hours a day working on your clothes. This can be done around a camp fire, in a comfortable inn or even in the back of a wagon. Once you have completed a number of days required, you must then roll a Weaver's Tools (Dexterity) check against the DC of the clothes you are working on.

On a success, you complete the design. On a failed check, you realize there is a fault in the clothes and they must be repaired. See Repairs for more information.

## Types of Clothes

As varied as the races and culture of your world, so too are the designs of clothing. Some clothes are only good for dances, others are required to go hiking in, while some are only good to show off your wealth. When you begin sewing your clothes, you must decide on the design before you can begin crafting. You can not change the design during your weaving, instead you must start over from the beginning.

### Measurements

When creating your design, you need the measurements of who you are crafting the clothes for. So long as you have a bit of paper to write down the measurements, or have the creature with you at all the times you are crafting, you can make progress on their clothes.

If you don't want to force your companion to be with you every time you are working on their clothes, you can simply take down their measurements and keep that with you. No action required. If you are trying to make clothes for someone you can't take their measurements of and don't have them available, you can make a Weaver's Tools (Intelligence) check against a 15 DC. If you fail the check, you are unable to create your design as you can't figure out their measurements.

### Repairs

If your clothes, or someone else's clothes, are damaged during your adventures, you must spend a quarter of the days (rounded down) required to restitch seams and replace broken fabric. During this time, the clothes are unable to be worn and grant no benefits. Once the repairs are completed, and the time has elapsed, you must succeed on a Weaver's Tools (Dexterity) check agianst the DC of the design you are repairing, you ahve advantange on this check if the clothes were originally designed by you.

On a success, they are repaired and can be used like usual. On a failed roll, you must restart the process on repairing them.

### Cloth and Materials

Certain designs and cloths are better suited for certain tasks over others, and some may require better materials. Depending on the design, and the purpose of them, the cost of the materials may make certain designs exorbitantly expensive. The cost for materials will be listed with the desired design.

When creating your designs, you must have the appropriate bolts of cloths avaiable, or have access to a loom and cotten to produce your fabrics. This takes up to a day, or more depending on the design or style, to produce enough fabric to make a single outfit and does not count toward the number of days to sew your outfit. Silk and Cotton are the only materials that can be on a loom.

### Designs

The designs of your clothes may lend themselves to dancing, climbing or swimming. When you begin design your clothes, you must first determine what type you are working on. Once you decide on the Design, you can begin crafting the clothes. After you have completed the clothes, they may provide a benefit based on their design. Only the creature that the clothes were designed for can utilize this benefit, if anyone else tries to wear the clothes, they do not fit properly and receive no benefit from the clothes.
