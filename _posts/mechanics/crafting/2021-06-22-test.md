## Herbalism Kit

Exploring out into the forest, a ranger can quickly find special ingredients to create poultices, salves and cures. These powerful concoctions are created through the natural ingredients of their environment, though their potency is quick to fade once acquired.

### What's in the Toolkit?

The following text replaces the text found on pg. 82 of ***Xanathar's Guide to Everything:***

An herbalism kit includes pouches to store herbs, clippers and leather gloves for collecting plants, a mortar and pestle, and several glass jars and vials.Proficiency with this kit allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any Herbalism Kit checks, and allows you to create any recipes you know.

### Foraging and Crafting 

In order to create your recipes, you must spend time to forage for the proper ingredients. Before heading off looking for ingredients, you must first choose which recipe you wish to create, and then over the course of an hour, you can forage through whatever terrain you are in, in the search of rare flowers, moss or whatever else the recipe calls for.

At the end of an hour, you then must roll a Herbalism Kit check using your Wisdom modifier, plus your Proficiency bonus, to craft the item. This check determines if you were able to locate any of the herbs you were looking for and the potency of the herbs. There are three potencies when creating your recipes: Minor, Moderate, and Masterwork.

Once you create a Recipe, it will lose its potency after 24 hours and reduces in potency. *I.e. If you craft a Masterwork item, in 24 hours, and it has not been used, it will reduce in potency to Moderate. A Minor item that reduces in potency after 24 hours is no longer potent enough to work.*

### Recipes

By knowing recipes, you know which ingredients are required to craft an Herbal Recipe, where you can find the ingredients and how to substitute items based on what is in the area.

Each recipe features the environment where you can find the correct ingredients, and per the DMs discretion you may be able to find the required ingredients in a different one. This may add disadvantage on your Herbalism Kit check.

Each recipe also features different DCs required to craft Minor, Moderate and Masterwork potent items. Certain recipes may call for highly specialized ingredients that you can not find in the usual manner, this may be something you must go on a quest for or spend weeks, even years, tracking down the ingredients.

#### Recipes Known

Characters with proficiency in the Herbalism Kit know 3 recipes and may be able to learn new recipes if they can find other herbalist, find herbalist notes or by experimenting with different plants in their environment.

### Traveling

While traveling, you can forgo foraging for food and instead forage for ingredients for specific recipes. While doing so, you cannot perform any other task and must pay attention to how far away you travel from your group.

If you are traveling at a **Normal Pace**, you can gather enough ingredients for one recipe every 3 hours; at a **Slow Pace**, you can gather enough ingredients for one recipe every 2 hours. At a **Fast Pace**, you can not gather any ingredients.

So long as a Ranger is in their Favored Terrain, they can make the required Herbalism Kit checks with advantage.

### Analyzing Items

If you find a Herbal Recipe, you can use your Herbalism Kit to analyze the item. It takes one hour of work to analyze the item and the item is destroyed in the process. At the end of the hour, roll a Herbalism Kit Check. If you meet or exceed the DC required to craft the item at Masterwork potency, you learn the recipe. Otherwise the item is destroyed and you learn nothing.

### Purchasing Items 

You are able to purchase Herbal Recipes and their items from Herbalists. The cost listed with each Herbal Recipe is the cost to buy an item from a Herbalist. This cost may be more than what is listed depending on a variety of factors, dependent on the GM's discretion. All purchased Herbal Items still expire within 24 hours of purchasing them.

### List of Recipes

#### Burnsoothe Ointment

This paste, composed primarily of roots and plant oils, reduces pain and speeds the recovery of burns. If applied to a creatureâ€™s wounds within 10 minutes of their taking fire damage from any source or if applied within 10 minutes at the end of an encounter during which they took fire damage from any source, the creature heals hit points depending on the potency.

* **Cost:** 20 / 40 / 60 gp
* **Environment:** Forest, Swamp
* **Potency DC:** 10 / 15 / 20
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** Creature heals 1d6 hit points when applied.
  * **Moderate:** Creature heals 1d6 + 2 hit points when applied.
  * **Masterwork:** Creature heals 1d8 + 2 hit points when applied.

#### Contact Poison

General poison that you can either coat your blade with or smear it on an object. When you coat it on an object, or a blade, it lasts for 1 hour, at which point its exposure to oxygen renders it useless. Whenever a creature touches the coated object, or on each successful attack roll against them once per turn, they take poison damage dependent on potency.

* **Cost:** 20 / 40 / 60 gp
* **Environment:** Forest, Swamp
* **Potency DC:** 15 / 20 / 25
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** 1d4 poison damage when touched or hit.
  * **Moderate:** 1d6 poison damage when touched or hit.
  * **Masterwork:** 2d4 poison damage when touched or hit.

#### Drunk Legs

These pine needles are blended with a mixture of algae and muck to create a tonic that will leave muscles twitching. Mixing this with a drink will create a vile tasting concoction that when ingested will cause muscles to weaken and to not respond to commands from the body. When ingested, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and ability checks for the next hour. To force feed someone this mixture, you must complete two grapple checks to complete the maneuver, the first one grabs them, the second forces the concoction in them, so long as they have a mouth. 

Save DC is dependent on potency. They can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes to end the effect early.

* **Cost:** 10 / 20 / 30 gp
* **Environment:** High-Altitude Forests, Caves
* **Potency DC:** 12 / 18 / 23
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** DC 10 for effect.
  * **Moderate:** DC 13 for effect.
  * **Masterwork:** DC 15 for effect.

#### Gashglue

This thick gray glue takes a full minute to apply to the bare skin. The glue temporarily holds damaged tissue together for up to 4 hours, at which point it dries up and flakes off. If applied within 10 minutes of receiving any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, a certain number points of that damage is restored in the form of temporary hit points. If the temporary HP exceeds the damage taken, you regain only up to the damage take, not beyond.

*For example, if you took 5 points of damage, and you rolled 6 temporary hit points, you only get 5 temporary hit points.*

* **Cost:** 10 / 20 / 30 gp
* **Environment:** Forest, Swamp
* **Potency DC:** 10 / 15 / 20
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** 1d4 + Wisdom Modifier potential temporary hit points.
