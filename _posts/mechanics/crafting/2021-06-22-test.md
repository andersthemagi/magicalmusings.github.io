## Herbalism Kit

Exploring out into the forest, a ranger can quickly find special ingredients to create poultices, salves and cures. These powerful concoctions are created through the natural ingredients of their environment, though their potency is quick to fade once acquired.

### What's in the Toolkit?

The following text replaces the text found on pg. 82 of ***Xanathar's Guide to Everything:***

An herbalism kit includes pouches to store herbs, clippers and leather gloves for collecting plants, a mortar and pestle, and several glass jars and vials.Proficiency with this kit allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any Herbalism Kit checks, and allows you to create any recipes you know.

### Foraging and Crafting 

In order to create your recipes, you must spend time to forage for the proper ingredients. Before heading off looking for ingredients, you must first choose which recipe you wish to create, and then over the course of an hour, you can forage through whatever terrain you are in, in the search of rare flowers, moss or whatever else the recipe calls for.

At the end of an hour, you then must roll a Herbalism Kit check using your Wisdom modifier, plus your Proficiency bonus, to craft the item. This check determines if you were able to locate any of the herbs you were looking for and the potency of the herbs. There are three potencies when creating your recipes: Minor, Moderate, and Masterwork.

Once you create a Recipe, it will lose its potency after 24 hours and reduces in potency. *I.e. If you craft a Masterwork item, in 24 hours, and it has not been used, it will reduce in potency to Moderate. A Minor item that reduces in potency after 24 hours is no longer potent enough to work.*

### Recipes

By knowing recipes, you know which ingredients are required to craft an Herbal Recipe, where you can find the ingredients and how to substitute items based on what is in the area.

Each recipe features the environment where you can find the correct ingredients, and per the DMs discretion you may be able to find the required ingredients in a different one. This may add disadvantage on your Herbalism Kit check.

Each recipe also features different DCs required to craft Minor, Moderate and Masterwork potent items. Certain recipes may call for highly specialized ingredients that you can not find in the usual manner, this may be something you must go on a quest for or spend weeks, even years, tracking down the ingredients.

#### Recipes Known

Characters with proficiency in the Herbalism Kit know 3 recipes and may be able to learn new recipes if they can find other herbalist, find herbalist notes or by experimenting with different plants in their environment.

### Traveling

While traveling, you can forgo foraging for food and instead forage for ingredients for specific recipes. While doing so, you cannot perform any other task and must pay attention to how far away you travel from your group.

If you are traveling at a **Normal Pace**, you can gather enough ingredients for one recipe every 3 hours; at a **Slow Pace**, you can gather enough ingredients for one recipe every 2 hours. At a **Fast Pace**, you can not gather any ingredients.

So long as a Ranger is in their Favored Terrain, they can make the required Herbalism Kit checks with advantage.

### Analyzing Items

If you find a Herbal Recipe, you can use your Herbalism Kit to analyze the item. It takes one hour of work to analyze the item and the item is destroyed in the process. At the end of the hour, roll a Herbalism Kit Check. If you meet or exceed the DC required to craft the item at Masterwork potency, you learn the recipe. Otherwise the item is destroyed and you learn nothing.

### Purchasing Items 

You are able to purchase Herbal Recipes and their items from Herbalists. The cost listed with each Herbal Recipe is the cost to buy an item from a Herbalist. This cost may be more than what is listed depending on a variety of factors, dependent on the GM's discretion. All purchased Herbal Items still expire within 24 hours of purchasing them.

### List of Recipes

#### Burnsoothe Ointment

This paste, composed primarily of roots and plant oils, reduces pain and speeds the recovery of burns. If applied to a creatureâ€™s wounds within 10 minutes of their taking fire damage from any source or if applied within 10 minutes at the end of an encounter during which they took fire damage from any source, the creature heals hit points depending on the potency.

* **Cost:** 20 / 40 / 60 gp
* **Environment:** Forest, Swamp
* **Potency DC:** 10 / 15 / 20
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** Creature heals 1d6 hit points when applied.
  * **Moderate:** Creature heals 1d6 + 2 hit points when applied.
  * **Masterwork:** Creature heals 1d8 + 2 hit points when applied.

#### Contact Poison

General poison that you can either coat your blade with or smear it on an object. When you coat it on an object, or a blade, it lasts for 1 hour, at which point its exposure to oxygen renders it useless. Whenever a creature touches the coated object, or on each successful attack roll against them once per turn, they take poison damage dependent on potency.

* **Cost:** 20 / 40 / 60 gp
* **Environment:** Forest, Swamp
* **Potency DC:** 15 / 20 / 25
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** 1d4 poison damage when touched or hit.
  * **Moderate:** 1d6 poison damage when touched or hit.
  * **Masterwork:** 2d4 poison damage when touched or hit.

#### Drunk Legs

These pine needles are blended with a mixture of algae and muck to create a tonic that will leave muscles twitching. Mixing this with a drink will create a vile tasting concoction that when ingested will cause muscles to weaken and to not respond to commands from the body. When ingested, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and ability checks for the next hour. To force feed someone this mixture, you must complete two grapple checks to complete the maneuver, the first one grabs them, the second forces the concoction in them, so long as they have a mouth. 

Save DC is dependent on potency. They can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes to end the effect early.

* **Cost:** 10 / 20 / 30 gp
* **Environment:** High-Altitude Forests, Caves
* **Potency DC:** 12 / 18 / 23
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** DC 10 for effect.
  * **Moderate:** DC 13 for effect.
  * **Masterwork:** DC 15 for effect.

#### Gashglue

This thick gray glue takes a full minute to apply to the bare skin. The glue temporarily holds damaged tissue together for up to 4 hours, at which point it dries up and flakes off. If applied within 10 minutes of receiving any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, a certain number points of that damage is restored in the form of temporary hit points. If the temporary HP exceeds the damage taken, you regain only up to the damage take, not beyond.

*For example, if you took 5 points of damage, and you rolled 6 temporary hit points, you only get 5 temporary hit points.*

* **Cost:** 10 / 20 / 30 gp
* **Environment:** Forest, Swamp
* **Potency DC:** 10 / 15 / 20
* **Effects:**
  * **Minor:** 1d4 + Wisdom Modifier potential temporary hit points.

Shaping and forming wood, you can carve wood and morph it into shapes useful for not only combat but art as well.

### What's in the Toolkit?

Woodcarver's tools consist of a carving knife, a gouge, a small mallet, and a small saw. Your tools weigh 5 lbs and cost 2gp.

#### Woodcarving 

Carving wood into beautiful art or deadly weapons requires that you have materials present, because your expertise and tools are designed for wood, you must have wood handy.There are some types of wood, like hardwoods or magically enhanced wood, that might be more difficult to craft or have special properties you can impart into your projects.

When carving, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) check, and you can add your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with said tools. 

### Creating your Project 

Woodcarving can be a very short process if you are crafting a simple statue that fits in your palm or it can be a week long endeavor to create beautiful designs on a man-sized totem. To carve wood, you must spend at least 10 minutes, or more depending on the project. A small wooden figure of a horse may only take a skilled carver 10 minutes, while a throne fit for a king may require several weeks or months. Most simple projects require up to an hour to complete. The more elaborate the design, or the size required, the longer the piece takes to complete per the DM's discretion. Examples are given below. Carving wood can be defined into 2 broad categories: **detail** and **scope**.

#### Detail 

The detail of your carvings affects the length of time to complete your project. There are three categories for your projects: **Vague, Light,** or **Heavy** detail. All times represent the minimum for each project, and at the DM's discretion they might take longer. 

**Vaguely** detailed projects require at least 5 minutes to work an appropriately sized piece of wood plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. A vaguely detailed project might be a set of arrow shafts, a door wedge, or other basic shapes. *Vaguely detailed projects add a +1 to Carving DC*.

**Lightly** detailed projects require at least 1 hour plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. Lightly detailed projects generally consist of multiple basic shapes combined to create figurines, or slightly complicated designs. For example, you could create a figurine of a horse but not include any details like fur or hooves. *Lightly detailed projects add a +3 to Carving DC*.

**Heavily** detailed projects require at least 8 hours to carve plus the time it requires for the scope of the project. Heavily detailed projects consist of carved patterns or intricate shapes, such as feathers on a bird or adding the wrinkles on a wooden face. *Heavily detailed projects add a +6 to Carving DC*.

#### Scope 

The scope of the project affects the length in time to carve out the shape in wood. The scope represents the size of your creations and there are three categories: **Minute, Substantial,** or **Immense**. All times represent the minimum time to create projects of a certain scope, and at the DM's discretion may take longer. 

**Minute** projects require at least 5 minutes to carve plus the amount of time it requires for the detail of the project. A project of this scope is something small enough to fit or be handled easily with a single hand. This includes things like figurines, arrow shafts, or objects that weigh below 2 lbs. Minute 

**Substantial** projects require at least 1 hour plus the amount of time it requires for the detail of the project. A substantial project is something relatively large-sized that can easily be handled with two hands. Examples might include a shield, quarterstaff, or objects that weigh below 30 lbs. 

**Immense** projects require at least 8 hours to create plus the amount of time required for the detail of the project. An immense project could be a throne, a pulpit, a wooden wall or anything that requires a lot of effort or multiple people to move about. 

#### Creating the Project 

After the project is completed, or 8 hours of work has been completed, the crafter must succeed on a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) check. On a success, they make progress on their creation or finish it depending on detail and scope. On a fail of 10 or less, they make no progress. On a fail of 11 or more, they have broken or damaged the project in such a way as to decrease its value. Restarting the project may be necessary at that point. 

The DC for carving a project is heavily dependent on the **detail** and **scope**. The DC for Carving is:
<p align = "center">
  <b>Carving DC:</b> <i>8 + Detail Bonus + Scope Bonus</i>
</p>
The DM may decide that certain details or sizes may raise or lower the DC, or adjust how often or little you need to roll to make progress. If you are creating a heavily detailed and immense throne, making a check every 8 hours may be too much left to chance. Ultimately, the number of checks required is simply a recommendation. Some example projects are included below:

|Project|Detail|Scope|Time|Carving DC|# of Checks|
|:------|:-----|:----|:--:|:--------:|:---------:|
|Arrow  |Vague |Minute|10 min.|10|1|
|Small Carving Board|Vague|Minute|10 min.|10|1|
|Figurine of a Horse|Light|Minute|1 hour|12|1|
|Quarterstaff|Light|Substantial|1 hr.|15|1|
|Shield|Light|Substantial|2 hrs.|15|1|
|Intricate Whistle|Heavy|Minute|8 hrs.|15|1|
|Throne for a Sprite|Heavy|Minute|8 hrs.|15|1|
|Owl Statue|Heavy|Substantial|9 hrs.|17|2|
|Temple Pulpit|Heavy|Immense|16+ hrs.|20|2+|

#### Limited Tools 

To make the tools easy to carry around on your travels, you have very few tools and may not be able to work on orojects of Immense scope. If you have access to a workshop with a full set of carving tools, the DM may decide to give you advantage on Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) checks or reduce the amount of time it takes to complete a project. 

### Searching for Materials 

Before you can begin a project, you must first acquire your materials. To create your project, you must find a suitable chunk of wood that is approximately the same size as the project you wish to create. You can always take wood away, but it is much harder to add additional wood to make a project larger.

Unless you have some other means of gathering your material, you must journey through forests searching for the right chunks to use for the project. A Nature check can be made to find materials, and the Material Search DC is dependent on the type of forests around you and the size of the project. A few examples are provided below:

|DC | Scope of Project | Density / Type of Forest |
|:-:|:-----------------------|:-----------------|
|5 |Minute     | Extremely dense, lots of trees         |
|8 |Minute     |Thinning Forest, mostly new growth      |
|10|Minute     |Forest dying to disease, mostly saplings|
|10|Substantial|Extremely dense, lots of trees          | 
|13|Substantial|Thinning forest, mostly new growth      |
|15|Substantial|Forest dying to disease, mostly saplings|
|15|Immense    |Extremely dense, lots of trees          |
|18|Immense    |Thinning forest, mostly new growth      |
|20|Immense    |Forest dying of disease, mostly saplings|

The quality of the forst and the scope of the project can make it very difficult to find the right size of wood needed for your creation. There is the potential you could **buy** the required chunk of wood in town with the following example prices provided.

|Type of Wood|Weight|Cost|
|:-----------|:----:|:--:|
|Softwood      |1 lb  |2 cp |
|Hardwood      |1 lb  |1 gp |
|Petrified Wood|1 lb  |3 gp |
|Dragon Burned |1 lb  |5 pp |

#### Softwood

Softwood is the typical wood used by most woodcarvers for their projects. It is cheap and easy to come by. It has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Softwood breeds include Birch, Fir, Teak, and Walnut.

#### Hardwood

Hardwood is a common type of wood that is harder than regular wood, making it ideal for long lasting design and weaponry. If a weapon is made out of hardwood, it deals +1 additional damage on a hit. It has an AC of 12 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. Hardwood breeds include Mahogany, Oak, and Pine. 

#### Petrified Wood

This wood has been petrified, either by a basilisk, or through a long process of fossilization. Due to how hard it is, it provides ample durability and additional force when used in weaponry. When you score a critical hit with a weapon made of this material, it deals one additional die of damage (applied AFTER the damage is doubled). It has an AC of 15 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Any breed of wood can become petrified.

#### Dragon Burned

When a forest is scoured by draconic breath, some trees are so enveloped in the blasts that aspects of the dragon's magic infuses the wood with that particular element. When used in weaponry, this magical wood allows the weapon to deal elemental damage instead of its normal damage type. It has an AC and hit points of its original breed, however it gains no other benefits.
