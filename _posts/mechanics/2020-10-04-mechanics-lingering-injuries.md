<a href="http://farlandworld.com/injuries.html">Adapted from "The World of Farland" post on Lingering Injuries </a>

Combat should feel real, and have consequences on both sides to determine just how bad that encounter really was. Although you can't necessarily account for all possible ways combat can go, you can generalize potential "issues" that might arise. War veterans tend to be chock full of complications after returning from battle. D&D tends to gloss over this with a group of adventurers, however, which led to many to want to implement a **lingering injury** system. 

A **lingering injury** is a debilitating effect that is sustained outside of combat. Most of these injuries can heal over time, or be treated by a doctor if you have enough money. **However, missing limbs and other body parts can only be restored by the use of *Regeneration* or similar spells.** Alternatively, they can also be replaced by costly prosthetics with DM approval. 

There are two ways a creature can sustain a lingering injury:
- When it takes a critical hit (or more than half it's health in damage by one hit)
- When it drops to 0 hit points, but isn't killed outright.

Once the potential for a lingering injury arises, the creature (or the player controlling the creature) will roll a Constitution save against a DC equal to the damage you took. If you fail, you must roll 1d20 on one of the tables below, depending on which damage type brought you to 0. 

## Optional Rule: Backstory Injury

When you first create a character to bring to the table, the DM may optionally allow you to exchange a permanent injury for a permanent (but related) benefit. For example, you could start with your eyes melted by acid, but having developed tremorsense to cope.

The benefit should be chosen such that if you cure the injury, you naturally lose the benefit as well.

## Acid 

|d20|Injury|Effect|
|:-:|:-----:|:---:|
|1|**Blindness**| Your eyes are destroyed; you gain the blinded condition.|
|2|**Partial Blindness**| Your eyes are damaged; you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. If you have already suffered partial blindness, you're blinded. |
|3|**Destroyed Hand**| You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. |
|4|**Destroyed Foot or Leg**| Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a crutch or cane to move. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance.|
|5-7|**Major Neuralgia**|  You are in constant pain from nerve damage. Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn.Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, cures the neuralgia, or if you spend twenty days doing nothing but resting it resolves on its own. |
|8-10|**Minor Neuralgia**| This has the same effect as Major Neuralgia above, except that the save DC is 10, and it only takes ten days to resolve on its own. |
|11-13|**Horrible Disfigurement**| You have acid burns to the extent that the scars can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
