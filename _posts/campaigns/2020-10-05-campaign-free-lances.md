## Session Log

### Session 4 - TBD (23 Oct 20)

Our party spent some time on their own the following day:

- Gallywix took on some minor work and helped a small shifter girl pull her cat out of a tree. The shifter girl was scared of Gallywix, but was at least willing to pay him for helping her retrieve her pet. He then spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the park in front of the Free Lance's guild hall. 
- Ana visited her favorite bookstore in Fairhaven, Kureon's Oddities, to spend some quiet time reading and picking up a quick spell scroll for later use. The shop is located in the Shadowatch district of the Besalle's Ward, a mostly residential area with some smaller shops littered about.  Kureon Hallorand is a well-educated khoravar particularly knowledgeable about the distant past. He is known to many academics as the city's foremost expert on the War of the Mark, ironically a fact that our faithful Medani foundling does not know. 
- Diva went back to performing at her tavern, the Lady in Blue, located in the Olladra's Gate district of the Besalle's ward. Olladra's Gate is known throughout the city for many famous taverns, and the Lady in Blue is no exception. Magicians and tricksters frequent the tavern and play harmless pranks on eachother when the performers aren't on stage, and the gnomish owner, Jak Lamplighter, is the biggest trickster of the bunch. As Diva completed her performance, her orphans Mayochup, Mayocue, and Kranch all walk in to keep her company and have dinner as the night continued. 

The next morning, Gallywix noticed a gang of shifters making trouble at the Imperia Magewrights in the Free Lances Guild Hall. The two goblins working there, Dobs and Chut, were being harassed as to the whereabouts of a missing child in the Silverclaw pack. Gallywix quickly stepped up and decided nobody was going to harass his kin, and a fight broke out straight away. Ana shortly after she saw the conflict (and Gallywix get a nice claw to the face) and rushed in to support her ally, whipping the leader with necrotic energy to knock him out instantly. As the fight continued, Diva coincidentally sauntered into the guild hall with her breakfast bagel before realizing the mess that was occuring in the shop. It took some well placed strikes and the pleas of Dobs and Chut to stop the conflict, where the party learned that the child was stolen by a goblin in black robes, hence the Silverclaws thinking it was the goblins of the rival Kech Motrai. Their only lead was the information known by Lurro Silverclaw, matron of the pack and owner of the Souphouse 10 minutes down the road.

Lurro's Souphouse is as busy as it is cozy. The interior of the hall is always steamy, giving it the foggy atmosphere of a jungle, with the sharp tang of spices always hovering in the air. Our heroes found Lurro serving her patrons, and reluctant to give any information, especially to the likes of goblins. Diva quickly saw the look of a distraught mother and persuaded Lurro to talk more on the missing child, and they were brought into the kitchen to speak more. It turns out that both her granddaughter, Thicket, and her son Brahl are missing. Brahl went to go look for Thicket as soon as she disappeared, with no indication of where he went. The shifter gang leader, Ace, slowly regained conciousness before being berated by his 'ma' on his behavior. Ace agreed to take them to where Thicket was last seen.

The location Ace takes them to is... oddly uneventful. A crossroads between alleyways that shows no sign of conflict or struggle. The party decides to investigate further, and although Gallywix found himself face first in a nearby barrell, Diva and Ana sussed out what looked to be an open manhole and decided to jump in. Ace declined to follow them in for one reason or another. 

Our heroes continue into the sewers, coming into contact with repugnant odors and plenty of wall moss before arriving at a tunnel marked with a goblin symbol for 'here.' They decide to hop down and traverse the muck, quickly getting ambushed by two crocodiles that have made their home in the waterways. Ana and Gallywix both were pulled underwater by the crocodile's gaping maws, but they successfully dispatched the creatures before any serious injuries were sustained. 

### Session 3 - "Well, they don't usually tattoo babies..." (16 Oct 20)

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

Professor Xendros noted that she was a specialist in the containment of magical energies, and was experimenting with new ways to conjure beasts using 'spell orbs,' hence the reason why the Quori spirit was contained in her bag (now identified as a Bag of Holding.) She also noted her ability to 'procure' items for adventurers from the Archive in the University of Wynarn if the party has the money. Before the party left, Xendros made a note of Ana's 'peculiar mark' on her forehead and pointed Ana in the direction of House Medani for more information. Our adventurers were paid 125gp each and were quickly ushered out of Xendros' office. 

Afterwards, Gallywix stopped by the House Orien post office to send some money to his wife and kids in the mail. He convinced the party to stop by a local 'Catgirl Cafe' ran by only Tabaxi in the Knowledge Ward. All the party members purchased some type of coffee drink before sitting down. Gallywix attempted to pickpocket Ana, and a fight almost broke out between the two in the cafe if it wasn't for their drinks being delivered. While the party was enjoying their beverages, Gallywix decided to "help" an orcish patron win the heart of one of the waitresses, a white-haired Tabaxi by the name of Alicia. Kubrag was quickly brought from fear to anger as Gallywix poured coffee onto him, forcing Kubrag to ake off his shirt in the cafe. Alicia and Kubrag quickly got to talking about a potential date and went off to find Kubrag a shirt. Before leaving, Leon bought Ana a pair of cat ears from the cafe as a souvenir.

The party decided next to stop by the House Medani enclave located in the Chequer's Ward of Fairhaven. Bankers, deliverymen and other types of clerks tend to frequent the district, and the opulent building presented to our adventurers only compounded that relationship House Medani had with the city. An extremely well-built khoravar guarded the door and brought Ana (and only Ana) inside the enclave to meet the Lord of the Enclave, Taldor d'Medani. His gaze was fixed on Ana long before she even entered the room, and Taldor's eccentric mannerisms only further lended to her fear of being knee-deep in unknown territory. He told Ana of the nature of her mark, the Mark of Detection, that brought her power and a birthright to soar above others in the land. Ana didn't really understand most of the eugenics associated with his speech, but Taldor resolved to attempt and find information about this 'foundling' within the next couple of days before quickly showing her out of the enclave. 

Next, our heroes decided to stop by the market in the Besalle's Ward nearby. Gallywix attempted to trade up a crate of tomatoes for some blunts of tobacco while Diva took one of the gems they found against the bandits and had it inlaid in gold with a local jeweler. Leon and Ana decided to hit up a local Sovereign Host temple to make a quick prayer, much to Ana's dismay as a cleric devoted to The Keeper. Leon made a quick prayer to Aureon in order to bless his sword. The acolytes inside were somewhat wary of Ana's presence, but Leon hastily managed to convince them she was here to repent before bolting from the establishment in its entirety. 

Later, our party spent a couple of days idling in and out of the Free Lance's guild hall before Taldor d'Medani set foot with his consort into the hall to find Ana. They noted that they could not find any records of her heritage, and asked for her parent's names. "Ferris and Agnes" was what Ana said before Taldor left her an open invitation to come and reclaim her heritage, if she so wishes. He then promptly left the hall. 

### Session 2 - A Dance with the Inspired (10 Oct 20)

When the party woke up after being attacked by Needle Blights the previous evening, Gallywix was intent on making the team some breakfast. He actually managed to find some bird eggs and mushrooms to make a decent omelette. Ana and Leon both decided to help by finding herbs and tomatoes respectively, however only Ana found anything worthwhile in the outcroping. Once breakfast was over, the party set out to the presumed location of the bandits. 

Our adventurers came to the clearing in the cover of night. Although not everyone was well versed in stealth, our party managed to make their way to the center of the camp with minimum issues and a large "glizzy" in Leon's bag. Conflict ensued when Ana stealth-bonked one of the bandits in the head as Leon impaled another with his javelins. Gallywix was knocked out mid-combat and sustained a nasty scar trailing from his left cheekbone down his neck to his right shoulder. The bandit captain, in possession of the bag, attempted to open it to hopefully find a weapon or item strong enough to deter the attackers. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a Quori spirit ensnared in the bag's magics, and quickly the bandit captain was forced to be an Inspired puppet, summoning crysteel daggers to make quick work of our heroes. Luckily between Ana's necrotic power and Diva's quick swordplay, the possessed captain was killed and the spirit flew away into the night. 

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

### Session 1 - Secure the Bag (25 Sep 20)

Our adventurers began their story in the Free Lances' Guild Hall, located in the Grangehall Ward of Fairhaven in the country of Aundair. We found two of our party members, Gallywix and Diva, having a casual old discussion in the common area before noticing Alzarif staring at them from another table. Gallywix decides to stop by the Questmaster, "Jeff", for the newest quests. Not many catch the team's eyes except for one hastily written paper that just requests that a bag be recovered for 500gp from a group of bandits. Unfortunately there was not much more information to go off of, until Ana, a cleric in the guild, came over and read the paper using her Mark of Detection. Invisible ink detailed the location by which the bandits had presumably riden to, and the party was ready to head out. That is, until "Jeff" pointed out the fact that they had no muscle. Between a Bard, Cleric, Rogue, and Sorcerer, it was clear that there needed to be a tank of sorts in order to balance out their team against potential assailants. After a quick call around the room for help, a Paladin by the name of Leon rose from his table and decided to help our adventurers. 

As they traveled north-west from Fairhaven, our party made their way through farmland. Many farmers in such a magically advanced country like Aundair tend to utilize their knowledge of artifice to their benefit. Leon was the only one bewildered by this fact, stunned at the sight of floating farm equipment being a casual occurance in the countryside. The party found their way to an outcropping midway between their presumed location and set up camp. In the night during one of their watches, several Needle Blights came out of the trees and attacked our party. No serious injuries occured, besides Diva casting Thunderclap to destroy two of the creatures outright. The rest of the night was uneventful as the party finished their long rest before setting out the next day on the road again.
