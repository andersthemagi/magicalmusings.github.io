## Session Log

### Session 3 - "Well, they don't usually tattoo babies..." (16 Oct 20)

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

Professor Xendros noted that she was a specialist in the containment of magical energies, and was experimenting with new ways to conjure beasts using 'spell orbs,' hence the reason why the Quori spirit was contained in her bag (now identified as a Bag of Holding.) She also noted her ability to 'procure' items for adventurers from the Archive in the University of Wynarn if the party has the money. Before the party left, Xendros made a note of Ana's 'peculiar mark' on her forehead and pointed Ana in the direction of House Medani for more information. Our adventurers were paid 125gp each and were quickly ushered out of Xendros' office. 

Afterwards, Gallywix stopped by the House Orien post office to send some money to his wife and kids in the mail. He convinced the party to stop by a local 'Catgirl Cafe' ran by only Tabaxi in the Knowledge Ward. All the party members purchased some type of coffee drink before sitting down. Gallywix attempted to pickpocket Ana, and a fight almost broke out between the two in the cafe if it wasn't for their drinks being delivered. While the party was enjoying their beverages, Gallywix decided to "help" an orcish patron win the heart of one of the waitresses, a white-haired Tabaxi by the name of Alicia. Kubrag was quickly brought from fear to anger as Gallywix poured coffee onto him, forcing Kubrag to ake off his shirt in the cafe. Alicia and Kubrag quickly got to talking about a potential date and went off to find Kubrag a shirt. Before leaving, Leon bought Ana a pair of cat ears from the cafe as a souvenir.

The party decided next to stop by the House Medani enclave located in the Chequer's Ward of Fairhaven. Bankers, deliverymen and other types of clerks tend to frequent the district, and the opulent building presented to our adventurers only compounded that relationship House Medani had with the city. An extremely well-built khoravar guarded the door and brought Ana (and only Ana) inside the enclave to meet the Lord of the Enclave, Taldor d'Medani. His gaze was fixed on Ana long before she even entered the room, and Taldor's eccentric mannerisms only further lended to her fear of being knee-deep in unknown territory. He told Ana of the nature of her mark, the Mark of Detection, that brought her power and a birthright to soar above others in the land. Ana didn't really understand most of the eugenics associated with his speech, but Taldor resolved to attempt and find information about this 'foundling' within the next couple of days before quickly showing her out of the enclave. 

Next, our heroes decided to stop by the market in the Besalle's Ward nearby. Gallywix attempted to trade up a crate of tomatoes for some blunts of tobacco while Diva took one of the gems they found against the bandits and had it inlaid in gold with a local jeweler. Leon and Ana decided to hit up a local Sovereign Host temple to make a quick prayer, much to Ana's dismay as a cleric devoted to The Keeper. Leon made a quick prayer to Aureon in order to bless his sword. The acolytes inside were somewhat wary of Ana's presence, but Leon hastily managed to convince them she was here to repent before bolting from the establishment in its entirety. 

Later, our party spent a couple of days idling in and out of the Free Lance's guild hall before Taldor d'Medani set foot with his consort into the hall to find Ana. They noted that they could not find any records of her heritage, and asked for her parent's names. "Ferris and Agnes" was what Ana said before Taldor left her an open invitation to come and reclaim her heritage, if she so wishes. He then promptly left the hall. 

### Session 2 - A Dance with the Inspired (10 Oct 20)

When the party woke up after being attacked by Needle Blights the previous evening, Gallywix was intent on making the team some breakfast. He actually managed to find some bird eggs and mushrooms to make a decent omelette. Ana and Leon both decided to help by finding herbs and tomatoes respectively, however only Ana found anything worthwhile in the outcroping. Once breakfast was over, the party set out to the presumed location of the bandits. 

Our adventurers came to the clearing in the cover of night. Although not everyone was well versed in stealth, our party managed to make their way to the center of the camp with minimum issues and a large "glizzy" in Leon's bag. Conflict ensued when Ana stealth-bonked one of the bandits in the head as Leon impaled another with his javelins. Gallywix was knocked out mid-combat and sustained a nasty scar trailing from his left cheekbone down his neck to his right shoulder. The bandit captain, in possession of the bag, attempted to open it to hopefully find a weapon or item strong enough to deter the attackers. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a Quori spirit ensnared in the bag's magics, and quickly the bandit captain was forced to be an Inspired puppet, summoning crysteel daggers to make quick work of our heroes. Luckily between Ana's necrotic power and Diva's quick swordplay, the possessed captain was killed and the spirit flew away into the night. 

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

### Session 1 - Secure the Bag (25 Sep 20)

Our adventurers began their story in the Free Lances' Guild Hall, located in the Grangehall Ward of Fairhaven in the country of Aundair. We found two of our party members, Gallywix and Diva, having a casual old discussion in the common area before noticing Alzarif staring at them from another table. Gallywix decides to stop by the Questmaster, "Jeff", for the newest quests. Not many catch the team's eyes except for one hastily written paper that just requests that a bag be recovered for 500gp from a group of bandits. Unfortunately there was not much more information to go off of, until Ana, a cleric in the guild, came over and read the paper using her Mark of Detection. Invisible ink detailed the location by which the bandits had presumably riden to, and the party was ready to head out. That is, until "Jeff" pointed out the fact that they had no muscle. Between a Bard, Cleric, Rogue, and Sorcerer, it was clear that there needed to be a tank of sorts in order to balance out their team against potential assailants. After a quick call around the room for help, a Paladin by the name of Leon rose from his table and decided to help our adventurers. 

As they traveled north-west from Fairhaven, our party made their way through farmland. Many farmers in such a magically advanced country like Aundair tend to utilize their knowledge of artifice to their benefit. Leon was the only one bewildered by this fact, stunned at the sight of floating farm equipment being a casual occurance in the countryside. The party found their way to an outcropping midway between their presumed location and set up camp. In the night during one of their watches, several Needle Blights came out of the trees and attacked our party. No serious injuries occured, besides Diva casting Thunderclap to destroy two of the creatures outright. The rest of the night was uneventful as the party finished their long rest before setting out the next day on the road again.
