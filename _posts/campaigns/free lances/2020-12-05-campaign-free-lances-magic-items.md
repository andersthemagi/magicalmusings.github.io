## Deck of Fates

***Requires Attunement (by an oracle).*** The Deck of Fates is a deck of 103 cards, which is most commonly found wrapped in black papyrus, covered with arcane and demonic symbols. The decks were created by Archduke Glaxus, former ruler of the sixth layer of Hell, Malbolge, as a means to toy with mortals. Each card’s depicted arcana is gilded with a gold-like substance crafted by Glaxus’ infamous Kyton workshop. No one knows just how many of the tarot decks exist. After a card is revealed from the deck, the arcana depicted is traced by a glowing light and the card turns to ash in the wielder’s hands. 

## Dr. Boom's Personal Projectile (PP) Launcher

"Hell hath no fury like a brother scorned"

***Requires Attunement (by Dr. Boom or one of his triplet brothers)***

To attune, this gauntlet of repurposed warforged metal requires the command word, **bababooey**, to be spoken while a creature fitting the attunement requirements has it equipped. 

While attuned, this gauntlet has 7 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the Magic Missile spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The missiles take the appearance of small, metallic projectiles adorned with Dr. Boom's drawings and graffitti. 

The gauntlet regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at danw. If you expend the gauntlets last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gauntlet self-destructs and is destroyed, dealing 4d6 force damage to all creatures within 10ft of the gauntlet.

## Bone Knight Longsword

***Requires Attunement.*** While the wearer is attuned, they deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage on a successful hit.

## Large Beholder Eye

***Requires Attunement.*** While attuned, the holder can cast Antimagic Field once per day. The holder cannot be surprised while attuned to the eye. Because of the feeling of being watched, everyone within 30 feet of the eye takes an extra hour to gain a long rest. 

The Large Beholder Eye can be mastercrafted (smith’s tools) into a grotesque Sentinel Shield. The holder of the shield cannot be surprised while attuned to it. Because of the feeling of being watched, everyone within 30 ft. of the shield takes an extra hour to gain a long rest. Worth 125gp

## Magic Cards 

### Azure Drake 

As a bonus action. You conjure a pseudodragon familiar made of pure mana. For 1 hour, your spells do an additional 2 damage.

### Archmage Antonidas

You can cast the fireball spell without requiring material components.

### Babbling Book

You can learn 1 1st-level spell or lower from the Wizard spell list. 

### Grim Patron

The next time you get hit, you can expend a reaction to summon a shadow clone of yourself. This shadow clone moves on your initiative order and can take one action during your turn. Any spell slots, abilities or consumables used by the shadow clone count as you using them (i.e. you don't get a free spell or an extra pool of ki points). Upon receiving any damage, the shadow clone dissipates and you gain one level of exhaustion.

### Hand of Protection

As a bonus action, a creature of your choice within 30ft gains 1 Divine Shield.

**Divine Shield** - The next damage you take only deals 1 hit point, breaking the divine shield in the process. Multiple instances of Divine Shield can be stacked on one creature. 
### Preparation

As a bonus action, you can cast this card. The next spell you cast is cast as if it was 1 spell slot level higher. 
### Sylvanas Windrunner

A creature within 60ft must pass a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become under your control until the next turn. This control works identically to control found in the spell **Crown of Madness**.

## Midnight Cloak

***Requires Attunement.*** While the wearer is attuned, they are immune to exhaustion.

## Pallid Banner

***Requires Attunement.*** As a bonus action, the attuned creature can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw equal to your spell DC or become friendly and obeys your control.
