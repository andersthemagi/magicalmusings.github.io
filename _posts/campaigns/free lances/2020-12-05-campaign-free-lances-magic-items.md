## Deck of Fates

***Requires Attunement (by an oracle).*** The Deck of Fates is a deck of 103 cards, which is most commonly found wrapped in black papyrus, covered with arcane and demonic symbols. The decks were created by Archduke Glaxus, former ruler of the sixth layer of Hell, Malbolge, as a means to toy with mortals. Each card’s depicted arcana is gilded with a gold-like substance crafted by Glaxus’ infamous Kyton workshop. No one knows just how many of the tarot decks exist. After a card is revealed from the deck, the arcana depicted is traced by a glowing light and the card turns to ash in the wielder’s hands.
