# Preface

***TL;DR: Don't be a dick.***

D&D is first and foremost meant to be a fun-for-all experience. If one or more participants aren't having fun, the game won't last long. The purpose of the **Adventurer's Accord** is to discuss the experience the players and DM are hoping for, as well as topics, themes, and behavior they deem inappropriate.

# Expectations

This section of the accord encompasses expectations for each member of the adventuring party, whether they be the DM or a player (or both!). 

## General Expectations

- Sessions are held on Fridays at 4pm MST. Time conversions for party members in other time zones follow. Always assume we have a session unless specifically told otherwise. **All members of the adventuring party are expected to show up as close to the specified time as feasible (if not earlier) to ensure the session ends on time.**
  - 1pm - 5pm HST
  - 6pm - 10pm EST
  - Saturdays, 10am - 2pm KOR
  - Sessions can and should be rescheduled when possible to best accommodate the party's other commitments.
- Should the DM or a player disrespecte each other or violate the accord in some other way, the group may discuss potential dismissal of that person from the table. 
- Any member of the adventuring party can recommend an ammendment or omission of the contents in this document. Any ammendments or omission **must** be discussed with the entire adventuring party. A 2/3 majority vote in favor of the ammendment or omission is required for any changes to take effect. 

## DM Expectations

- The DM will respect the players by running a game that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. The DM will allow every player to contribute to the ongoing story and give *every PC* moments to shine. When a player is talking, the DM is listening. 

## Player Expectations

- The players will respect the DM and the effort it takes to create a fun game for everyone. The players will allow the DM to direct the campaign, arbitrate the rules, and settle arguments. When the DM talks, the players are listening. 
- The players will respect one another, listen to one another, support eachother, and do their utmost to preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party.

# Campaign-specific Clauses

This section of the accord covers soft limits, hard limits, and other campaign specific clauses that are unique to the players and DM(s) that comprise this adventuring party at the table. 

## Character Actions

The game world is not a shooting gallery or GTA. Expect consequences for doing bad things to NPCs. PCs in this campaign are generally of good alignments, whether that be chaotic, neutral, or lawful is up to you to decide. 

Regardless of your character's alignment or demeanor, refrain from actions, both in-game and otherwise, that would make a member or the rest of the adventuring party actually uncomfortable or upset. 

## House Rules

- **Action Points**: Instead of using inspiration, I prefer to give action points (AP) that allow the player to add 1d6 to a roll of their choice. It has proven to make players less shy about pushing themselves in combat and makes the encounters much more meaningful when fate intervenes in anotherwise unwinnable scenario. <a href="https://magicalmusings.github.io/mechanics/action-points/">If you need more info on action points, check out my page on it.</a>
- **Downtime**: Players at the session receive 5 downtime (DT) for every 2 hours of gameplay. This DT can be exchanged for currency and other opportunities to continue your characters story beyond the session. <a href="https://magicalmusings.github.io/mechanics/downtime/">For more info about DT, check out my page on it.</a>
- **Loremaster Tokens**: Players that help me outside of sessions with worldbuilding (such as lore entries, drawings, maps, etc) earn LT that can be converted into currency, used to boost a roll, or even action points or downtime. <a href="https://magicalmusings.github.io/mechanics/loremaster-tokens/">You can read more about LT here.</a>

## Limits 

A **soft limit** is a threshold that one should think twice about crossing, as it is likely to create genuine anxiety, fear, and/or discomfort. A **hard limit** is a threshold that should never be crossed. These limits may be specific to in-game or out-of-game situations. Common in-game limits include themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racial profiling, slavery, violence towards children and animals, and intra-party romance. Common out-of-game limits may include unwanted physical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting, rules lawyering, and generally disrespectful behavior. 

Every member of the group has soft and hard limits, and it behooves everyone in the group to know what they are. The DM will make their best effort to avoid topics, in-game or otherwise, that make a member of the adventuring party unsafe or uncomfortable. Both kinds limits **for this party** are anonymously compiled and detailed below for reference.
