**FROM:** KCPT Sovir Titancrest, Regent Corps

**TO:**  Mercenaries from 'The Free Lances' Adventuring Guild

**SUBJECT:** After-Action Manifest of Otharaunt Skirmish

The purpose of this memorandum is to document necessary reward and payment for mercenary work on 8 Eyre 999 YK. Led by Sgt Lillia Xendros of the Knights Corps, a group of mercenaries from the Free Lances Adventuring Guild of Fairhaven wiped out a daelkyr outpost and secured an artillery encampment previously lost by the Knights Arcane. Seven members of the Squire Corps were sent for reconnaissance, and were killed in action as a result. This skirmish reflects greatly on the determination and valor of the mercenaries employed, as well as their loyalty and pride to the banner of Audair. 

## Rewards

Per the Code of Galifar's provision on mercenary corps, the Knights Arcane has agreed to pay the standard cost of 1 day of work based on location, difficulty of task, and importance of task (as identified and stratified by the Regent Corps). These payments are divided and made to the name of the following persons involved.
* Lady Ana d'Medani Lorg'astras
* Mr. Noggenfogger Rackateer
* Ms. Diva 'Thiccums'
* Mr. Seym Vanatar
* Dr. Kallista Xendros

### Procurement Manifest

Finally, the following items were obtained and sent in tandem with this manifest. Due to the nature of Dr. Xendros' tenure with the University of Wynarn, the Regent Corps found it apt to provide samples of daelkyr remains for study.

## Additional Notes 

The Regent Corps additionally would like to make it known that the aforementioned mercenaries identified and delivered 6 of 7 dogtags from fallen Knights Arcane soldiers out in the field. One body was charred beyond recognition, and dogtags were melted into the skin, although no daelkyr have been seen wielding fire magicks. Efforts are still ongoing to determine who that soldier was based on deployment orders. Although no monetary reward will be given, the families of those killed in action will be grateful to have closure with their loss. 

Of note, the Knights Arcane will be dropping any potential charges against Sil'quen, a companion of unknown origin that stayed behind during the skirmish in Otharaunt. Sil'quen was found trespassing in military quarters, supposedly trying to understand 'how the world has changed since the collective (?)'. The Squire Corps noted no file of Sil'quen in Aundairian or Galifarian records, leading the local leadership to believe him a citizen of Droaam, Darguun, or the Lhazaar Principalities. No further action is required, so long as this Sil'quen is not caught trespassing on government property in the future. 

Should the mercenaries of this company wish, the Knights Arcane may be willing to pay for additional provisions as necessary in regards to the daelkyr threat in the west. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesistate to contact me via return-letter. 

Very Respectfully,<br/>

SOVIR D. TITANCREST, KCPT, KNIGHTS ARCANE<br/>Commander, 3rd Battalion
