### Session 14 - A Darkness from the Stars (29 Jan 21)
DM: Andres S.

The Starpeaks Observatory stood as a single looming building against a snow-capped summit. Luscious, deep black architecture accented the ornamented shimmering gold details, as if the building itself was a stunning starscape. The dome reflects the setting sun in shades of blazing reds and oranges, and from the way the surface catches the drifting clouds, you could tell that the stars must alight across the surface at night. The well-worn path coaxes our party toward a blessedly warm building, where large arched doorways with crescent golden hands awaited them. Upon knocking, they were greeted by the originator of Nevi's letter, Ildaeva Luciana. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZKpXHwx/77162e89f0f35698d77e42ac74d89410.jpg" alt="Starpeak's Observatory" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

Ilda brought the party into a common room to discuss her concerns, mainly that her colleages have been working on a telescope for the past several months with no explanation as to why. Ilda also noted that as of late, a strange stone door appeared farther up the mountain that the researchers conveniently act as if the door is at there at all. Surely enough, the party went to go investigate, and noted that there was writing on the door in Celestial. Turns out the writing was a puzzle to gain entry into whatever lied beyond! The sun reflecting off of the glass moons of the orrery revealed a way into the stone doorway. 

They descended down into the mountain through a mysterious, enchanting tunnel. The stone was almost black in the darkness, but seemed to glitter with a faint gold when the torch's light dances along the surface. The steadiest source of light was the beam of sunlight unspooling into the depths, coaxing them inward. The beam reflects off of surfaces to make its way inward, as if pulled towards its destination by a force they could not see. Eventually this led the party to the den of a couple of Yeti's, who were quickly dispatched of. The tunnel descended deeper and deeper until they arrived at a room flanked with various depictions of draconic constellations and another door sealed with celestial writing. Luckily the puzzle was not too difficult, and the party opened the door and continued. Gravity in the tunnel began to dissipate as our adventurer's were faced with a room littered with floating "stars." Along the way, they found a small alcove containing various treasures before arriving at a large doorway. Several of the party members begun to have strange visions of space, enticing offers of power, and splitting headaches urging them to turn back. Quickly they realized the source of these visions as they stepped into the next room. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/0yZs437/50d63670582061b7e73c9e00b6736b25.jpg" alt="Cyrvas, the Hungry" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

Our adventurers entered a great cavern littered with remnants long forgotten. Faded tapestries and scattered etching told of a world of dreams and of the expanse of the universe, all of it faded until they could barely comprehend what they were seeing. The party beheld rings of landscapes they couldn't recognize, landscapes that seemed to shift from scene to scene with no explanation. The area was vast and looming. The dark stone, when visible, seemed more dappled with stars than ever before; even the ceiling, littered with stalactites, glowed with golden freckles, and the ground seemed to light up with gold under each footstep. Most apparent was the final destination of the now moonbeam: a lying dragon with scales like a dark night sky that rippled with gold and shimmering effects as it moves. Nevi attempted to talk with the creature, and it introduced itself as Cyrvas, the Hungry, and the source of the problems at the observatory. He remarked on the deliciousness of the party's ambitions before shifting the scene to an astral battlefield. Combat ensued! 

During the encounter, Nevi caught a glimpse the visage of a familiar (at least to the veterans of the party) khoravar sorcerer before the party was empowered with new magical strength. They had gained the power of ***Astral Sigil: Wandering Sorcerer***, a field spell that granted them bonuses to spell damage as well as on attempts to resist opposing magical effects. Luckily, not many of the party members were heavily damaged, and Cyrvas went down to Seym's last Toll the Dead. Where Cyrvas had originally stood, there then layed a strange, ugly looking creature Nevi recognized as a Quori. She immediately realized the true culprits of this fiasco in the mountains: The Dreaming Dark. 

Once the party had finished divvying up the loot, they exited the cavern to find the researchers making snowmen and snow angels as they threw bits of the telescope out into the snow. Ilda thanked the party profusely for freeing her colleagues of their unusual quest, and offered to take them back to town on a handcart for those that were somewhat badly injured. Our adventurers ended up staying in the Howling Winds Inn another night and sleeping the encounter with a dragon off as if it was just another dream. 

### Session 13 - His name is Borba?! (22 Jan 21)
DM: Andres S.

After finding themselves stranded in the middle of a scrapyard, the party (and a captured Ashe) began to realize things were far too cold for them to stay out in the open for long. The air was cold, and the snow was beginning to set in. Luckily they found some sort of shelter and scrounged for enough wood to make a fire for the night. That evening, the party had dreams of an ever-expansive space with stars, moons, and planets surrounding them, followed by the snuffing out of the stars and the glare of massive eyes peering into their soul. Seym and Flint awoke to find themselves standing outside in the snow the following morning.

The scene quickly shifted back to Fairhaven, to the sight of Nevitana, a red-haired young woman dressed in a thick-layered dress from the Eldeen Reaches, interacting with the Free Lances quartermaster, Borba (not "Jeff", suprisingly). Borba handed Nevi a letter she received from the Starpeaks Observatory in Northern Thrane, signed by Dr. Ildaeva Luciana. She urged Nevi to come and assist her, and that time was almost out before "it was complete." Borba suggested Nevi take the lightning rail to Tira's Vigil, the closest town to the observatory, only to have to explain in great detail what a lightning rail was. He also mentioned talking with a "Tulvir" once she got in town before Nevi left for the station. She was quickly blown agast by the size and grandeur of the Fairhaven Station and its daily bustle of travelers coming in and out. Coincidentally, the Thaliost Express was out of order for the time being, but there was a House Orien Land Transport stand nearby that could assist. The older-looking halfling man offered Nevi a cart with two horses for a nominal price, and she set off to Tira's Vigil. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/k5ZRGvM/nevi.jpg" alt="Nevitana" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

Ana and Gallywix set off to find some sort of road, and came across a lamppost indicating a road some twenty minutes uphill. By the time they told the party and all trekked up the snow-covered hill, they saw a young woman driving her horse-driven cart up the road. She stopped to ask if they needed help, and ended up offering them a ride to Tira's Vigil, the nearest town on the way. Some intimidation attempts were made to get Ashe to talk about her plans to no success as they introduced themselves to Nevi. 

Once they arrived in Tira's Vigil, another House Orien Land Transport stand took Nevi's cart in to hold while they were in town. They visited the local tavern, the Howling Winds, and rented a couple of rooms (one for the males, one for the females), with the females taking Ashe into their room. Soon after, an imposing brass-colored dragonborn came knocking on the men's room to inquire about the "fugitive" they had brought tied up into the inn. As he was searching, Nevi opened the door and asked if the dragonborn was Tulvir, eventually revealing him and Borba were long-time good friends. Diva revealed that Ashe was in the ladies' room, and Tulvir noted that Ashe had a bounty on her for some 100+ counts of smuggling and robbery. He took Ashe back to his "office" and bid the party a good day. Diva and Gallywix spent some time relaxing in the tavern's main hall, before joining the rest of the party to sleep.

Morning arrived soon after, and the party decided to stop by Tulvir's for some assistance. He indicated that the pass up to the Starpeaks is somewhat dangerous, and that locals have (albeit without proof) been attacked by yeti's on the pass. The party stopped by the general store, the North Peaks Emporium, to pick up some supplies and postcards to send home before beginning their trek up the mountains. Along the way they were attacked by a quartet of ice mephits that were quickly disposed of before arriving at the Starpeak Observatory. 


### Session 12 - Violence on the Thaliost Express (16 Jan 21)
DM: Keoni C.

Another normal day in Fairhaven for the party. The sun was shining, the birds were chirping, the snow had just begun to melt from the past couple of days of snow. Then the boombots began to scurry. Each of the party members quickly ran after the boombots until they found eachother at the bustling Fairhaven Station. They managed to hit, but not subdue, a boombot that was jumping on a train before hopping on themselves to finish the job.

<img src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/d54a99ee-2446-4fd0-a47f-d49c300b66b1/dcyijd0-ec37523d-e185-4918-a48c-ce44d95cd01c.png/v1/fill/w_600,h_800,q_80,strp/ashe___overwatch__2v__by_sciamano240_dcyijd0-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD04MDAiLCJwYXRoIjoiXC9mXC9kNTRhOTllZS0yNDQ2LTRmZDAtYTQ3Zi1kNDljMzAwYjY2YjFcL2RjeWlqZDAtZWMzNzUyM2QtZTE4NS00OTE4LWE0OGMtY2U0NGQ5NWNkMDFjLnBuZyIsIndpZHRoIjoiPD02MDAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ._NoXztcSuOqF1IRz_RT5sxQzAkEkUqudsM6VbLxIR-0" alt="Ashe" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

The train was, unfortunately, filled with various warforged guards, ammunition stores, as well as some strange purple and blue ores that the party ended up taking for themselves. They were later ambushed by a set of warforged guards and a larger-looking captain that intended to stop the party in their tracks before they reached the cockpit. That very same captain's head rolled towards the white-haired conductor's head, as she (Ashe) commanded her warforged bodyguard "Bob" to tackle Flint and keep the party at bay. Combat ensued, leading Flint to be shot by Ashe and him promptly decking her and tying her up. The rest of the party made quick work of "Bob" and reconvened at the cockpit, only to find that the train begun to shake and derail as if pushed by something enourmous. Seym cast featherfall on the party as they jumped out, finding themselves in the middle of a warforged scrapyard. 

### Session 11 - B-A-R-F-I-G-H-T (1 Jan 21)
DM: Andres S.

After a long day working at the Lady in Blue, Diva heard something rustling upstairs. She headed up to find the very same bone knight that they had defeated in the King's Rest now looking around confused as to where he was. Diva sat him down to talk and understand exactly how he came back to life, when the rest of the party arrived to enjoy a round of drinks. They learned a lot about the bone knight, named Steven, and his immortality thanks to Lady Illmarrow. Steven spent much of the conversation lost, trying to figure out a new direction for his life. Diva worked out an agreement with Jak to hire Steven as a bouncer, on the condition that the party finds a way to change Steven's imposing appearance. Eventually their search for assistance led them to the University of Wynarn. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tmPK8H7/flint-roughdraft.png" alt="Flint Silverclaw" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

They arrived on the university grounds when Seym was stopped by a familiar face, that of which was familiar to the entire party. Kubrag, the orc Gallywix had helped secure a date with one of the tabaxi at the Catgirl Cafe, was actually a professor at the university. More importantly, he was Seym's mentor for his capstone project to graduate with a degree in Arcane Transcription. Seym had been late on submitting a proposal for his project, and Kubrag gave him a week in order to come up with something in order to work on this upcoming semester. Kubrag later led the party back to a lab where Dr. Xendros had been working on some sort of spell orb that began to spill all over the floor. She suggested to the party that they heat up Steven and hit off a majority of the spikes and "bones" off of his armor, since they were actually made of metal. Diva cast Heat Metal on Steven, and Ana / Flint began to whack off bits of Steven's armor with some hammers. Although it was *somewhat* painful for Steven, he got through it alright, and what remained was a dented-up animated suit of armor. Before leaving to take Steven to a "repair shop," Gallywix lapped up some of the residue from Dr. Xendros' experiment. He quickly began to see the forms of the creatures around him shift into rotting shambling corpses akin to an episode of the Walking Dead.

The party's final stop that session was the Imperia Magewrights located in the Free Lances guild hall. They had helped Dobs and Chuts, the store owners, fend off some riled up shifters previously, and they were happy to assist in restoring Steven's metal form to something less beat up. Eventually, our adventurers went their separate ways for the day. Diva returned to the Lady in Blue to find a very large man dressed in expensive clothing bring his shades (indoors?) down to address her. Meanwhile, Ana and Seym spent some time looking into a potential project for Seym's capstone when they caught a glimpse of Tak Caldemus, one of the adventurer's who had presumably stolen Khyber's Eye and used it to blow up the King's Rest. 

### Session 10 - Lurro's "Hole in the Wall" Souphouse (28 Dec 20)
DM: Keoni C.

A string of explosions began to occur all throughout Fairhaven, leaving many places around town broken and needing repairs. One of these places was Lurro's Souphouse, where Flint Silverclaw, Lurro's son, decided he needed to apprehend the person responsible for such damages. Our party offered to help Flint fix the hole while also trying to find where Dr. Boom was hiding. Flint agreed and joined the party for the time being. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/C7Jyq4K/Ft4UYOY.png" alt="Seym" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

They decided to investigate the materials used for Gallywix' new toy, a projectile launcher left by Dr. Boom during his attack on the Feast Sojourn. Eventually, the search led the party back to the University of Wynarn, where Dr. Kallista Xendros unfortunately could not help them find more info about Dr. Boom's creations. She did refer them to the Aundair Library to find a scholar who may be more knowledgeable in the subject. Said scholar was none other than Seym, a wizard student studying Arcane Transcription. He assisted the party in finding that a company called Maliwan was the manufacturer. Not much could be gleamed beyond that, however Gallywix suggested they visit the museum in case the curators know more about warforged equipment. 

Our adventurer's arrived in the museum and were greeted by a peculiar warforged named Rex. Rex had once been a soldier in the Last War, but had later been repurposed to give guided tours of the museum. He led the party around and provided some information on a Sir Admiral Rackateer that served in the Aundairian military before being lost to the Mourning. The warforged also noted two old Maliwan warehouses in the Whiteroof Ward that may be worth checking out. The first ended up being a fishing warehouse where the party secured themselves some sweet po'boys. The second was guarded by an ogre that was kind enough (or stupid enough?) to let them in. 

This warehouse stunk of unkempt animal and feces, and many exotic animals were being kept for potential trade to other parts of the west. Unfortunately, the place was rigged to blow, and several boombots ambushed our party to distract them from the fuses. Luckily everyone managed to put out the fuses and the boombots before any explosion occurred. Investigation throughout the warehouse led Flint to a map of potential targets that Dr. Boom was casing for another attack. They immediately rushed to leave once they realized one of the locations was Gallywix' apartment, however not without almost running into police that were clearing the warehouse. Once they arrived at Gallywix' place, they searched all over, only to find a note that thankfully indicated Dr. Boom had tricked them. Fairhaven was safe, for now. 

### Session 9 - "Who named all the civilians after pornstars?" (18 Dec 20)
DM: Andres S.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tM7mMXH/baron-malgas.png" alt="Baron Malgas, Court of All Flesh" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

From the shadows, a flock of ravens converged onto the shoulder of Dr. Boom's warforged mech as Drego begins to monologue to the party at the Feast Sojourn. He reveals that Dr. Boom has been recruited to help them keep the party at bay as they have yet to move Khyber's Eye from Fairhaven. Drego then realizes he said too much, then promptly leaves. Combat begins against Dr. Boom!

Amidst the screaming and evacuation of aptly named civilians in the area, Ana uses the device given to her to contact Jorlanna d'Cannith and ask for help in arresting Dr. Boom. 
Meanwhile, Dr. Boom had already begun deploying his BoomBots to harass and destroy Gallywix and his compatriots. Wave after wave of BoomBot continued to strike at the party, nearly killing Gallywix in the process. At this point in the night, Ana seemingly had just about enough of Dr. Boom's antics, and called on The Keeper to hopefully get her and the rest of the party out of the bind they were currently in. Thus came Baron Malgas, a member of the Court of All Flesh, to answer Ana's pleas, cleaving Dr. Boom's armor and several of his BoomBots alike. 

As Dr. Boom prepared his missiles for a final strike against our adventurer's, an airship barrelled through the clouds to swing it's broadside towards the Feast Sojourn. From the deck, Rosani Valsys and her team from the Royal Eyes of Aundair swooped in to take down Dr. Boom, forcing him to self-destruct his mech and exit stage right. Rosani sees that the party is injured and takes them to the nearest House Jorasco clinic to get patched up before assuring the party she's on the case to hunt Dr. Boom and Khyber's Eye down.  

### Session 8 - Madness at the Feast Sojourn (11 Dec 20)
DM: Andres S.

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/966/1*-kx6tmbCxvHaTO5e6JMF7A.jpeg" alt="Rosani Valsys" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

Once the party finished up with the bone knight in King's Rest, they headed out of the crypt only to be stopped by none other than Taldor d'Medani and two other figures walked down the stairs they came in from. They introduced themselves as **Rosani Valsys**, Domestic Spymaster for the Royal Eyes of Aundair, and **Baroness Jorlanna d'Cannith**, matriarch of Cannith West. Jorlanna pulls Ana aside to interrogate her on the whereabouts of Khyber's Eye, what the party currently knew to be the red orb Grexes and his compatriots weilded previously. According to Jorlanna, Khyber's Eye was used during the war on aberrant dragonmarks to absorb the energy of the marks without killing the host, meaning several thousand people worth of arcane power were in the refined dragonshard. She gave Ana a small device to carry and call in case they find the orb in their travels. 

Our party exits the crypt to find that it had begun to snow in Fairhaven while they were in the crypt. The scars of the combat against the beholder zombie had already been hidden in ice, alongwith the corpse of the creature itself. Diva suggests to the party that they head to the Shabh Quarter, a neighborhood of changelings in the Marble Halls, to properly put Alzarif's remains to rest. She indicates she cannot come due to personal reasons, and leaves with Vivi in tow. As Gallywix and Ana are led into the neighborhood by the guards outside, they pass through various narrow alleyways intertwined between buildings that stand much higher than usual. People of all different races living out their normal lives, although much of them seem to look almost identical? The two swear they see the same person over and over again until they reach an inner square. 

Within the inner square stood a large poplar tree with a small hooded statue at it's base. A pale man stood amongs them with silver dreadlocks and a bleached tunic with many layers, introducing himself as Father Scad. He invites them in to discuss the funeral rites over water / tea, when a changeling with familiar vestiments serves them their drinks. The party quickly catches on to eachother as Vivi is seen stumbling into the room with Kranch pulling her quickly back behind the corner. Ana and Gallywix find out that Diva is actually Bee the changeling and that her well-endowed tiefling visage is a persona of hers. Later that evening, the funeral goes off without a hitch (besides Gallywix showing a tattoo of Alzarif on his chest to the attendees). Gallywix suggests that the party should take some time to destress with a visit to the Feast Sojourn, a Talentan tent city right outside of Fairhaven. 

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/9/93/Dr_Boom_Mad_Genius.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200426153113" alt="Dr. Boom!" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

The Feast Sojourn appears to most westerners as an exotic place straight out of the Talenta Plains. To Talenta halflings, it appears to be a foppish caricature. The colorful tents are nothing like the dun-colored tents that the nomadic Talenta tribes use and the “authentic dishes” sold in many of the merchant tents are bland and cloying compared to food from the plains themselves. In the winter time, they host games, rides, and various fun exhibits to entice citizens to visit despite the cold. The ticketmaster at the gate was none other than one of Gallywix's triplet brothers, **Burglor Rackateer**. Each member of the party ended up finding places in the Feast Sojourn they enjoyed. Ana decided to visit Hungry Hungry Hydras and contend against a live hydra, only to nearly lose to an invisible gnome had she not seen him with her Mark of Detection. Diva joined a fencing competition and narrowly won against Drego, a member of Grexes' party that decided to "show up" to the Feast Sojourn. Gallywix took Vivi and gambled a bit, playing Avandra's Favor and gaining a hefty 400+ gold win against Drego as well. As the party turned in their tickets to gain some magic cards, they heard the stomping of something massive making its way towards them. A warforged colossus barreled through the tents to point all of its missiles at Gallywix and yell "NOGGENFOGGER". And as the head of the warforged detached akin to a cockpit, the party saw another goblin in the control seat. Gallywix's other triplet brother, **Sparky Rackateer**, had come to introduce himself as...***DR. BOOM***!

### Session 7 - SPARE RIBS (4 Dec 20)
DM: Andres S.

Not much had changed from the last session up until now. Besalle's Ward was still in shambles, the beholder zombie laid dead, and Alzarif was nothing more than a steaming pile of ashes. After killing the beholder zombie, Diva went to inspect the remains, only to find that there were white hairs scattered within the ashes. The eyestalks of the beholder zombie began to twitch as the creature lifted itself back up off of the ground. A shot quickly rang out from the other side of the market from none other than Chrom as he closed in with two guards he had saved from death previously. For real this time, the beholder zombie had been killed.

As Ana began carving up the beholder zombie for potential loot, she stumbles upon a Bag of Holding containing a most curious bit of cargo. A Loxodon child lied hiding within clutching an ornate black and gold wooden box and shaking in fear. Ana remembers that loxodons are revered for their natural affinity towards divination from her reading at Kureon's. Meanwhile, Gallywix swoops in with a leftover set of vials from Dragon's Blood deliveries and picks up almost all of Alzarif's ashes. Diva came and picked the child up in her arms to console her as nearby, the guards that accompanied Chrom investigated the blast at the King's Rest entrance. Whatever had caused the explosion had left the metal doors sealing the crypt singed with green necrotic fire. The guards asked everyone whether they were willing to help secure King's Rest, on account of the rest of the Fairhaven Watch being occupied with undead on other parts of the ward.  Thoughout this request, Gallywix decided to pretend he was both blind and deaf, using his rapier as a seeing stick. 

Upon entry, our party was presented with a set of three stairs leading down deeper into King's Rest. Two of the stairways were marked with several dragonmark house insignia, and the center stairway was emblazoned with the crest of Aundair. Gallywix promptly continued his deaf/blind bit, falling down the center staircase. The two guards decide to investigate the other two parts of the crypt as the rest of the party followed Gallywix. The crypt had been both ransacked and now filled with the various shadows, ghouls, and poltergeists of the nobles that had once rested peacefully inside. Within a couple of minutes, all of the undead descended on the pary as Chrom decided to fire his sniper rifle against one of the poltergeists. One by one, the party began to be slowly whittled down, with Ana receiving the brunt of an unfortunate swarm of skeletons and zombies, and Gallywix nearly dying as shadows sapped the strength out of him. Luckily they perservered and moved deeper into the crypt, but not before finding out that their elephant companion had powers of her own. Vivi, as Diva had noted by the embroidery on her robes, had some sort of magical ability alongside the magic released by the box in her possession. 

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9e/ee/74/9eee74c339f0371d9726ee6981bd80ff.jpg" alt="The Bone Knight" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

They continue deeper until they slide open the doors to enter the main chamber, where several more soldiers in white-green tunics and a knight in armor covered in bone were searching for a "child with the box." Gallywix entered first and snuck in, steathily taking out the first soldier before he slumped in all his armor to the ground. The bone knight began talking and closing in on Gallywix along with his soldiers up until Chrom ran from behind a pillar and shot one of the other soldiers. The fight went on relatively uneventful, with many of the soldiers falling quickly to the hands of our heroes. Although the bone knight managed to get a hold of Vivi near the end, a well-placed strike by Diva killed the assailant where he stood. 

### Session 6 - Behold! (7 Nov 20)

Our story begins this time around with Diva performing at the Lady in Blue as usual, except now she has a glamerweave dress she uses to weave mystical illusions into her performances. The crowd loves it, and she makes a good deal of money in tips from that performance alone. Diva at this point is well on her way to becoming a headliner for the Lady in Blue, rather than the opening act. 

Ana, unfortunately, has been having strange dreams recently of death and destruction in relation to the red orb in her possession. That same night, Ana is attacked by a thief in the night. She notices the thief has a strange mark on their left hand, but not one she has seen in her work with House Medani, Orien, and Lyrandar. The assassin sustains a jaw injury on account of Ana's warhammer then promptly puts Ana to sleep with her mark. Ana's last moment of conciousness had her witness the thief grab the red orb out of her bag.

The following morning, Grexes, a well-knwon and respected Karrnathi Leonin amongst the members of the Free Lances, rouses Ana from her slumber. It seems that in the midst of escaping, the thief blew open a hole in Ana's room and created a great deal of noise, that of which Grexes came to investigate before knocking down her door. He brought Ana down to the main hall, where Alzarif, Diva and Gallywix were passing the time. While the rest of the party attempts to help Ana investigate, Gallywix is dragged by Jeff to meet with a visitor that requested him by name. A medusa from Daask sat at the other end of the table, and slid a bag full of "Dragon's Blood" vials and a set of addresses to deliver the product in the University of Wynarn, Shreve's End, the Orchid Court, and Shangha. Ana resolves to get more information about the orb from Kallista Xendros at the University of Wynarn.  

Kallista is confused as to the nature of the orb, or the cultists that possessed it. She leads the party down into the Archives of Wynarn to find a Mark of Scribing gnome from House Sivis known as Quaji. Quaji only finds information on a "Blackheart Cult," goblin worshippers of the Dark Six that take their beliefs in the Shadow a little too seriously. In the meantime, Gallywix delivers Dragon's Blood to a group of nervous House Sivis students in their dorms. 

The next stop in the investigation led back to House Medani, where Ana asked Taldor about whether the dragonmarks have any ability to make people sleep. Taldor shows Ana a list of dragonmarks, however Ana does not recognize any of them from the thief's hand. He assures Ana of the impossibility of an "aberrant" dragonmark being a part of the equation on account of the eradication of the 13th dragonmarked house, House Tarkanan, having taken place several hundred years prior. Gallywix stops by both Shreve's End and the Orchid Court to deliver to some shifters (who recognize him as a friend to the Silverclaws) and the twin sisters Alia and Jetra Naliamos of the Naliamos Brothers flower shop. 

Finally, Ana stops by Kureon's Oddities to attempt a last ditch effort in finding information on the assailant with little success. Kureon notes that any entries on House Tarkanan have been tampered with or incomplete in his archives. Ana meets Dr. Tak Caldemus, a halfling dressed in singed dark clothing that has an unhealthy obsession with fire. Tak seems annoyed with Ana's questions not pertaining to fire and promptly leaves the bookstore. Our faithful goblin coincidentally makes one final stop in Shangha, and leaves the remaining Dragon's Blood with Nevitana, a kalashtar druid that telepathically directs him as she performs deep-state meditation to commune with Quori spirits. Ana's investigation leads to nothing conclusive on potential identifying marks, up until the healers in the downstairs House Jorasco enclave of the guild hall noted a strange patron that came in the morning before. She had a dislocated jaw that needed fixing, a strange tattoo on her left hand, and a necklace affixed with an emerald claw. Unfortunately, not much else is found to lead Ana towards finding the thief. 

A couple of days later, and it is the 11th of Aryth in 998 YK, the late autumn period of the year and symbolic month for House Orien, heirs to the Mark of Passage. The 11th holds a special place in the hearts of Khorvaire's people as Thronehold Day. On this day in 996 YK (996 years after the kingdom of Galifar was founded) the treaty was ratified to end the Last War and recognize Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta plains, Thrane, Valenar and Zliargo as sovereign nations in Khorvaire. The Treaty of Thronehold also established a common set of laws between these nations and diplomatic requirements to uphold the peace of the treaty. For many Aundairians, the threat and fear of impending doom very much lingers and the day itself is a bittersweet reminder of the cataclysm known to many as the Mourning, where the entire nation of Cyre was engulfed in powerful dark magics almost overnight. Many are happy that the war is over and that there can be some peace and quiet, although some do not believe the Eldeen Reaches should be considered sovereign.

The festivities are mainly held in Nealford, close to the palace. Nearing the evening, Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn comes out to the balcony overlooking the festivities and delivers a speech commemorating the celebration. Diva sees, out of the corner of her eye, someone wearing a similar necklace to the patron described in House Jorasco a couple of days prior. In the midst of that speech, what looks to be a red glint of light rises in the distance. Red lightning begins to crackle from the glint, and all of a sudden a massive explosion rings out from the King's Rest in Besalle's Ward, and the necrotic energy rising up forms a set of green claws clutching at the red glint before it's pulled back towards the ground. Queen Aurala is quickly ushered to safety as our party members go to investigate the explosion. 

Undead of all kinds litter what was one a bustling marketplace in the Besalle's Ward. In the distance, our adventurers can hear the clamor of civilians attempting to escape and members of the city watch calling out to each other in combat. Gallywix and Alzarif take the western path while Diva and Ana flanked east. Most of the undead were fairly unresponsive and went down without much struggle, almost as if they themselves weren't sure why they were up in the first place. 

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/c/c7/Beholder_zombie-5e.png/revision/latest?cb=20171011164729" alt="Beholder Zombie" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

All the destruction about the marketplace came to a head nearby the King's Rest, where four figures stood holding the very same orb stolen from Ana. A platinum blonde tiefling with curly horns, a dark clothed man bearing a skull face tattoo and a gothic dulcimer, Grexes, and Tak discussed what to do now that the orb had been used in such a brazen fashion. Floating above the fountain in the plaza was a beholder zombie, an aberration of myth seemingly resurrected for nefarious purposes. Diva began to converse with the group to little success, as the tattooed man, Drego Entarro, shrouded them in skeletal dark energy wings before escaping. Soon after, Ana began cursing and ranting on the audacity of them to steal and use the orb in such a manner. The beholder zombie caught wind of that noise, and the fight commenced. 

Gallywix led the fight with several well-placed arrows piercing the eyes on the tendrils of the beholder zombie, while Ana shouted incantations and let off blasts of radiant fire to dispel the creature. Alzarif's eyes turned pale and his complexion dark as he began to attempt rending the mind (or what was left of a mind) from the creature. Diva sent a series of thunderous blasts into the beholder zombie before it attempted to fight back. Although the first ray from the beholder zombie did not amount to much when Ana was hit, Alzarif was not so lucky. The tendrils of the beholder zombie sent orbs of raw magical force into Alzarif's body. One by one, they ravaged him and left him gasping for air before the main eye brought its gaze upon him. A beam of almost nuclear necrotic energy engulfed Alzarif and eroded his being until there was nothing left but his belongings and dust. Alzarif had died to the hands of this beholder zombie. Diva was infuriated at the sight of Alzarif's suffering. She used all of her power to finally break the mind of the beholder zombie before leaving it a spasmic, heaping clump of rot in the plaza. Our heroes had won the day, but at what cost? And what of the orb now in the possession of Grexes and his compatriots?

### Session 5 - A deal with a Devilman (30 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

We find our story beginning this time around in Rordan's Gate. A large open circle of bricks is lined with neat-looking houses. In the middle, a statue of a man in armor is covered with roosting birds. This plaza was dedicated to General Aronne Cestman, a prominent military officer in the middle of the Last War. The plaza itself is well kept and quiet, with the occasional groups of people passing by to get around the ward for the day. Nearby to the statue, we find a figure with a dark brown cloak sitting almost intentionally discretely with their hands covering their face. The shine of silver pokes out at moments when the sun reflects off of the figure's skin… or are they scales?

<img src="https://i.redd.it/xxz8hohep6x31.jpg" alt="Chrom" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

An enforcer of the monster gang Daask, Chrom the Silver Dragonborn stood watch in protection of a paying client, Klara Cestman of Cestman Arms. He noted that there were some strange hooded figures approaching the shop and ran to investigate. It was really too bad that Chrom forgot it was Hallow's Eve! The poor kids looking for treats were met with an intimidating dragon-man telling them to leave. And leave they did. Klara was disappointed that Daask would intimidate children on a holiday, but figured some candy would sweeten Chrom's mood. Later, Chrom decided to visit Starpeak's Ale House for a quick bite. The restauraunt is one of the few who sell traditional dwarven ale, and has a reputation for some of the best food in the city. Chrom gives some of the candy to a couple of rowdy teens, only to find that they were magical candies. He washes down his sandwich with a fine dwarven ale and enjoys the sights and sounds of the patrons around him. 

Back in the sewers, the rest of the party had just finished beating the daylights out of two crocodiles that had attacked them. As they pushed on into the sewers, they stumbled upon a metal door that Diva yanked down with little effort. The door led into a giant cesspool of muck and gunk littered with various amount of junk. Ana noted there was a ladder-like arrangement of pipes leading up to an overhang. Upon reaching the overhang, the party found some belongings and a note reading ***"They took my daughter, I'll take their lives, the orb is the key"***. Before leaving the cesspool, a stray bear trap caught Ana's leg and dealt some damage, but nothing to permanently injure her. 

Chrom had finished his drink and decided to head home once an ogre tapped him on the shoulder to leave his post. As he was walking closer to Grangehall Ward, he noticed a suspicious dark-robed figure skulking about in the darkness and investigated. The goblin man quickly ran at the sight of the dragonborn, and a chase ensued. Whether it be by luck or by pure skill, Chrom managed to catch the strange goblin and interrogate him on his purpose out in the shadows. The goblin presumed Chrom was a member of the Royal Eyes, and spilled that there was something strange happening in the sewers. Chrom grabbed "Steve" under his arm and had the goblin indicate where they could enter the sewers, sliding down a pipe of sludge into the depths of the city.

Our heroes in the sewers continued on and went through a narrow passageway before being attacked by several giant rats. By the end of the conflict, a single rat remained. This rat would have survived if it was not for the impact our dragonborn friend made upon landing directly on it. Chrom didn't recognize anyone around him, but Gallywix knew Chrom to be a member of Daask almost instantly (considering his illegal substance running for them previously). For some reason, Gallywix feigned recognition of this remarkable dragonborn, and the party agreed to coalesce to figure out what was at the end of this sewer passageway. 

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/756368941022052382/771970770556551178/9f657cf48cb8ebc783cb61d14731eed5.png" alt="The bearded devil" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

At the end of the corridor, a huge room coated in old blood contains a pentagram drawn in chalk with lit candles. A bearded devil sat trapped within this arcane circle, with a shifter man and girl laying at its feet. Ana attempts to cast Spare the Dying on the child, only to find that the life energy she was imbuing into the child was sapping from the man. Be it by the magic containing the devil or otherwise, the shifter man shrivels into a husk. Chrom decides to investigate farther into the room to find several goblin cultists chanting incantations to a crackling red orb. He decides that's too much for him to handle and slowly backs into the previous room before closing the door. Ana and Gallywix make a pact with the bearded devil. Ana requests eldritch power and for the devil to kill the goblins in the next room. Gallywix decides he also wants eldritch power from the devil. The devil happily allows the two to conditionally forfeit their souls before breaking the seal with his new found power, then subsequently burning the cultists in the next room to a fiery crisp. 

The party takes the shifter girl (and "Steve") back to Lurro's Souphouse, where all the shifters in the room are shocked to see Thicket alive and well. Lurro is heartbroken that her sun died "at the hands of goblins" but is glad that Thicket is alive, and that there is a goblin in the room who can be blamed for all of this. Lurro makes a last remark to Diva telling her to take care as a fellow mother. Our heroes take Chrom to the Free Lances Guild Hall in order to register, as he is coincidentally needing some extra money to make ends meet. Jeff is sullied that there are more people that tolerate Gallywix on this planet. 

### Session 4 - Sewer Swimming (23 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

Our party spent some time on their own the following day:

- Gallywix took on some minor work and helped a small shifter girl pull her cat out of a tree. The shifter girl was scared of Gallywix, but was at least willing to pay him for helping her retrieve her pet. He then spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the park in front of the Free Lance's guild hall. 
- Ana visited her favorite bookstore in Fairhaven, Kureon's Oddities, to spend some quiet time reading and picking up a quick spell scroll for later use. The shop is located in the Shadowatch district of the Besalle's Ward, a mostly residential area with some smaller shops littered about.  Kureon Hallorand is a well-educated khoravar particularly knowledgeable about the distant past. He is known to many academics as the city's foremost expert on the War of the Mark, ironically a fact that our faithful Medani foundling does not know. 
- Diva went back to performing at her tavern, the Lady in Blue, located in the Olladra's Gate district of the Besalle's ward. Olladra's Gate is known throughout the city for many famous taverns, and the Lady in Blue is no exception. Magicians and tricksters frequent the tavern and play harmless pranks on eachother when the performers aren't on stage, and the gnomish owner, Jak Lamplighter, is the biggest trickster of the bunch. As Diva completed her performance, her orphans Mayochup, Mayocue, and Kranch all walk in to keep her company and have dinner as the night continued. 

The next morning, Gallywix noticed a gang of shifters making trouble at the Imperia Magewrights in the Free Lances Guild Hall. The two goblins working there, Dobs and Chut, were being harassed as to the whereabouts of a missing child in the Silverclaw pack. Gallywix quickly stepped up and decided nobody was going to harass his kin, and a fight broke out straight away. Ana shortly after she saw the conflict (and Gallywix get a nice claw to the face) and rushed in to support her ally, whipping the leader with necrotic energy to knock him out instantly. As the fight continued, Diva coincidentally sauntered into the guild hall with her breakfast bagel before realizing the mess that was occuring in the shop. It took some well placed strikes and the pleas of Dobs and Chut to stop the conflict, where the party learned that the child was stolen by a goblin in black robes, hence the Silverclaws thinking it was the goblins of the rival Kech Motrai. Their only lead was the information known by Lurro Silverclaw, matron of the pack and owner of the Souphouse 10 minutes down the road. 

<img src="https://dungeonmusings.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/f36d44e074c0d30ef89ee178c160548a.jpg?w=660" alt="Ace Silverclaw" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

Lurro's Souphouse is as busy as it is cozy. The interior of the hall is always steamy, giving it the foggy atmosphere of a jungle, with the sharp tang of spices always hovering in the air. Our heroes found Lurro serving her patrons, and reluctant to give any information, especially to the likes of goblins. Diva quickly saw the look of a distraught mother and persuaded Lurro to talk more on the missing child, and they were brought into the kitchen to speak more. It turns out that both her granddaughter, Thicket, and her son Brahl are missing. Brahl went to go look for Thicket as soon as she disappeared, with no indication of where he went. The shifter gang leader, Ace, slowly regained conciousness before being berated by his 'ma' on his behavior. Ace agreed to take them to where Thicket was last seen.

The location Ace takes them to is... oddly uneventful. A crossroads between alleyways that shows no sign of conflict or struggle. The party decides to investigate further, and although Gallywix found himself face first in a nearby barrell, Diva and Ana sussed out what looked to be an open manhole and decided to jump in. Ace declined to follow them in for one reason or another. 

Our heroes continue into the sewers, coming into contact with repugnant odors and plenty of wall moss before arriving at a tunnel marked with a goblin symbol for 'here.' They decide to hop down and traverse the muck, quickly getting ambushed by two crocodiles that have made their home in the waterways. Ana and Gallywix both were pulled underwater by the crocodile's gaping maws, but they successfully dispatched the creatures before any serious injuries were sustained. 

### Session 3 - "Well, they don't usually tattoo babies..." (16 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

Professor Xendros noted that she was a specialist in the containment of magical energies, and was experimenting with new ways to conjure beasts using 'spell orbs,' hence the reason why the Quori spirit was contained in her bag (now identified as a Bag of Holding.) She also noted her ability to 'procure' items for adventurers from the Archive in the University of Wynarn if the party has the money. Before the party left, Xendros made a note of Ana's 'peculiar mark' on her forehead and pointed Ana in the direction of House Medani for more information. Our adventurers were paid 125gp each and were quickly ushered out of Xendros' office. 

Afterwards, Gallywix stopped by the House Orien post office to send some money to his wife and kids in the mail. He convinced the party to stop by a local 'Catgirl Cafe' ran by only Tabaxi in the Knowledge Ward. All the party members purchased some type of coffee drink before sitting down. Gallywix attempted to pickpocket Ana, and a fight almost broke out between the two in the cafe if it wasn't for their drinks being delivered. While the party was enjoying their beverages, Gallywix decided to "help" an orcish patron win the heart of one of the waitresses, a white-haired Tabaxi by the name of Alicia. Kubrag was quickly brought from fear to anger as Gallywix poured coffee onto him, forcing Kubrag to ake off his shirt in the cafe. Alicia and Kubrag quickly got to talking about a potential date and went off to find Kubrag a shirt. Before leaving, Leon bought Ana a pair of cat ears from the cafe as a souvenir. 

<img alt="Lord Taldor d'Medani of Fairhaven" src="https://i.ibb.co/xXzz5h6/taldor.png" width ="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px;">

The party decided next to stop by the House Medani enclave located in the Chequer's Ward of Fairhaven. Bankers, deliverymen and other types of clerks tend to frequent the district, and the opulent building presented to our adventurers only compounded that relationship House Medani had with the city. An extremely well-built khoravar guarded the door and brought Ana (and only Ana) inside the enclave to meet the Lord of the Enclave, Taldor d'Medani. His gaze was fixed on Ana long before she even entered the room, and Taldor's eccentric mannerisms only further lended to her fear of being knee-deep in unknown territory. He told Ana of the nature of her mark, the Mark of Detection, that brought her power and a birthright to soar above others in the land. Ana didn't really understand most of the eugenics associated with his speech, but Taldor resolved to attempt and find information about this 'foundling' within the next couple of days before quickly showing her out of the enclave. 

Next, our heroes decided to stop by the market in the Besalle's Ward nearby. Gallywix attempted to trade up a crate of tomatoes for some blunts of tobacco while Diva took one of the gems they found against the bandits and had it inlaid in gold with a local jeweler. Leon and Ana decided to hit up a local Sovereign Host temple to make a quick prayer, much to Ana's dismay as a cleric devoted to The Keeper. Leon made a quick prayer to Aureon in order to bless his sword. The acolytes inside were somewhat wary of Ana's presence, but Leon hastily managed to convince them she was here to repent before bolting from the establishment in its entirety. 

Later, our party spent a couple of days idling in and out of the Free Lance's guild hall before Taldor d'Medani set foot with his consort into the hall to find Ana. They noted that they could not find any records of her heritage, and asked for her parent's names. "Ferris and Agnes" was what Ana said before Taldor left her an open invitation to come and reclaim her heritage, if she so wishes. He then promptly left the hall. 

### Session 2 - A Dance with the Inspired (10 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

When the party woke up after being attacked by Needle Blights the previous evening, Gallywix was intent on making the team some breakfast. He actually managed to find some bird eggs and mushrooms to make a decent omelette. Ana and Leon both decided to help by finding herbs and tomatoes respectively, however only Ana found anything worthwhile in the outcroping. Once breakfast was over, the party set out to the presumed location of the bandits. 

Our adventurers came to the clearing in the cover of night. Although not everyone was well versed in stealth, our party managed to make their way to the center of the camp with minimum issues and a large "glizzy" in Leon's bag. Conflict ensued when Ana stealth-bonked one of the bandits in the head as Leon impaled another with his javelins. Gallywix was knocked out mid-combat and sustained a nasty scar trailing from his left cheekbone down his neck to his right shoulder. The bandit captain, in possession of the bag, attempted to open it to hopefully find a weapon or item strong enough to deter the attackers. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a Quori spirit ensnared in the bag's magics, and quickly the bandit captain was forced to be an Inspired puppet, summoning crysteel daggers to make quick work of our heroes. Luckily between Ana's necrotic power and Diva's quick swordplay, the possessed captain was killed and the spirit flew away into the night. 

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

### Session 1 - Secure the Bag (25 Sep 20)
DM: Andres S.

Our adventurers began their story in the Free Lances' Guild Hall, located in the Grangehall Ward of Fairhaven in the country of Aundair. We found two of our party members, Gallywix and Diva, having a casual old discussion in the common area before noticing Alzarif staring at them from another table. Gallywix decides to stop by the Questmaster, "Jeff", for the newest quests. Not many catch the team's eyes except for one hastily written paper that just requests that a bag be recovered for 500gp from a group of bandits. Unfortunately there was not much more information to go off of, until Ana, a cleric in the guild, came over and read the paper using her Mark of Detection. Invisible ink detailed the location by which the bandits had presumably riden to, and the party was ready to head out. That is, until "Jeff" pointed out the fact that they had no muscle. Between a Bard, Cleric, Rogue, and Sorcerer, it was clear that there needed to be a tank of sorts in order to balance out their team against potential assailants. After a quick call around the room for help, a Paladin by the name of Leon rose from his table and decided to help our adventurers. 

As they traveled north-west from Fairhaven, our party made their way through farmland. Many farmers in such a magically advanced country like Aundair tend to utilize their knowledge of artifice to their benefit. Leon was the only one bewildered by this fact, stunned at the sight of floating farm equipment being a casual occurance in the countryside. The party found their way to an outcropping midway between their presumed location and set up camp. In the night during one of their watches, several Needle Blights came out of the trees and attacked our party. No serious injuries occured, besides Diva casting Thunderclap to destroy two of the creatures outright. The rest of the night was uneventful as the party finished their long rest before setting out the next day on the road again.
