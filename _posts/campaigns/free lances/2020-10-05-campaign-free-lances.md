### Session 7 - SPARE RIBS (4 Dec 20)
DM: Andres S.

Not much had changed from the last session up until now. Besalle's Ward was still in shambles, the beholder zombie laid dead once more, and Alzarif was nothing more than a steaming pile of ashes. After killing the beholder zombie, Diva went to inspect the remains, only to find that there were white hairs scattered within the ashes. The eyestalks of the beholder zombie began to twitch as the creature lifted itself back up off of the ground. A shot quickly rang out from the other side of the market from none other than Chrom as he closed in with two guards he had saved from death previously. For real this time, the beholder zombie had been killed.

As Ana began carving up the beholder zombie for potential loot, she stumbles upon a Bag of Holding containing a most curious bit of cargo. A Loxodon child lied hiding within clutching an ornate black and gold wooden box and shaking in fear. Ana remembers that loxodons are revered for their natural affinity towards divination from her reading at Kureon's. Meanwhile, Gallywix swoops in with a leftover set of vials from Dragon's Blood deliveries and picks up almost all of Alzarif's ashes. Diva came and picked the child up in her arms to console her as nearby, the guards that accompanied Chrom investigated the blast at the King's Rest entrance. Whatever had caused the explosion had left the metal doors sealing the crypt singed with green necrotic fire. The guards asked everyone whether they were willing to help secure King's Rest, on account of the rest of the Fairhaven Watch being occupied with undead on other parts of the ward.  Thoughout this request, Gallywix decided to pretend he was both blind and deaf, using his rapier as a seeing stick. 

Upon entry, our party was presented with a set of three stairs leading down deeper into King's Rest. Two of the stairways were marked with several dragonmark house insignia, and the center stairway was emblazoned with the crest of Aundair. Gallywix promptly continued his deaf/blind bit, falling down the center staircase. The two guards decide to investigate the other two parts of the crypt as the rest of the party followed Gallywix. The crypt had been both ransacked and now filled with the various shadows, ghouls, and poltergeists of the nobles that had once rested peacefully inside. Within a couple of minutes, all of the undead descended on the pary as Chrom decided to fire his sniper rifle against one of the poltergeists. One by one, the party began to be slowly whittled down, with Ana receiving the brunt of an unfortunate swarm of skeletons and zombies, and Gallywix nearly dying as shadows sapped the strength out of him. Luckily they perservered and moved deeper into the crypt, but not before finding out that their elephant companion had powers of her own. Vivi, as Diva had noted by the embroidery on her robes, had some sort of magical ability alongside the magic released by the box in her possession.

They continue deeper until they slide open the doors to enter the main chamber, where several more soldiers in white-green tunics and a knight in armor covered in bone were searching for a "child with the box." Gallywix entered first and snuck in, steathily taking out the first soldier before he slumped in all his armor to the ground. The bone knight began talking and closing in on Gallywix along with his soldiers up until Chrom ran from behind a pillar and shot one of the other soldiers. The fight went on relatively uneventful, with many of the soldiers falling quickly to the hands of our heroes. Although the bone knight managed to get a hold of Vivi near the end, a well-placed strike by Diva killed the assailant where he stood. 

### Session 6 - Behold! (7 Nov 20)
DM: Andres S.

Our story begins this time around with Diva performing at the Lady in Blue as usual, except now she has a glamerweave dress she uses to weave mystical illusions into her performances. The crowd loves it, and she makes a good deal of money in tips from that performance alone. Diva at this point is well on her way to becoming a headliner for the Lady in Blue, rather than the opening act. 

Ana, unfortunately, has been having strange dreams recently of death and destruction in relation to the red orb in her possession. That same night, Ana is attacked by a thief in the night. She notices the thief has a strange mark on their left hand, but not one she has seen in her work with House Medani, Orien, and Lyrandar. The assassin sustains a jaw injury on account of Ana's warhammer then promptly puts Ana to sleep with her mark. Ana's last moment of conciousness had her witness the thief grab the red orb out of her bag.

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/756368941022052382/774817072664412191/2Q.png" alt="Grexes the Warden" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

The following morning, Grexes, a well-knwon and respected Karrnathi Leonin amongst the members of the Free Lances, rouses Ana from her slumber. It seems that in the midst of escaping, the thief blew open a hole in Ana's room and created a great deal of noise, that of which Grexes came to investigate before knocking down her door. He brought Ana down to the main hall, where Alzarif, Diva and Gallywix were passing the time. While the rest of the party attempts to help Ana investigate, Gallywix is dragged by Jeff to meet with a visitor that requested him by name. A medusa from Daask sat at the other end of the table, and slid a bag full of "Dragon's Blood" vials and a set of addresses to deliver the product in the University of Wynarn, Shreve's End, the Orchid Court, and Shangha. Ana resolves to get more information about the orb from Kallista Xendros at the University of Wynarn.  

Kallista is confused as to the nature of the orb, or the cultists that possessed it. She leads the party down into the Archives of Wynarn to find a Mark of Scribing gnome from House Sivis known as Quaji. Quaji only finds information on a "Blackheart Cult," goblin worshippers of the Dark Six that take their beliefs in the Shadow a little too seriously. In the meantime, Gallywix delivers Dragon's Blood to a group of nervous House Sivis students in their dorms. 

The next stop in the investigation led back to House Medani, where Ana asked Taldor about whether the dragonmarks have any ability to make people sleep. Taldor shows Ana a list of dragonmarks, however Ana does not recognize any of them from the thief's hand. He assures Ana of the impossibility of an "aberrant" dragonmark being a part of the equation on account of the eradication of the 13th dragonmarked house, House Tarkanan, having taken place several hundred years prior. Gallywix stops by both Shreve's End and the Orchid Court to deliver to some shifters (who recognize him as a friend to the Silverclaws) and the twin sisters Alia and Jetra Naliamos of the Naliamos Brothers flower shop. 

Finally, Ana stops by Kureon's Oddities to attempt a last ditch effort in finding information on the assailant with little success. Kureon notes that any entries on House Tarkanan have been tampered with or incomplete in his archives. Ana meets Dr. Tak Caldemus, a halfling dressed in singed dark clothing that has an unhealthy obsession with fire. Tak seems annoyed with Ana's questions not pertaining to fire and promptly leaves the bookstore. Our faithful goblin coincidentally makes one final stop in Shangha, and leaves the remaining Dragon's Blood with Nevitana, a kalashtar druid that telepathically directs him as she performs deep-state meditation to commune with Quori spirits. Ana's investigation leads to nothing conclusive on potential identifying marks, up until the healers in the downstairs House Jorasco enclave of the guild hall noted a strange patron that came in the morning before. She had a dislocated jaw that needed fixing, a strange tattoo on her left hand, and a necklace affixed with an emerald claw. Unfortunately, not much else is found to lead Ana towards finding the thief. 

A couple of days later, and it is the 11th of Aryth in 998 YK, the late autumn period of the year and symbolic month for House Orien, heirs to the Mark of Passage. The 11th holds a special place in the hearts of Khorvaire's people as Thronehold Day. On this day in 996 YK (996 years after the kingdom of Galifar was founded) the treaty was ratified to end the Last War and recognize Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta plains, Thrane, Valenar and Zliargo as sovereign nations in Khorvaire. The Treaty of Thronehold also established a common set of laws between these nations and diplomatic requirements to uphold the peace of the treaty. For many Aundairians, the threat and fear of impending doom very much lingers and the day itself is a bittersweet reminder of the cataclysm known to many as the Mourning, where the entire nation of Cyre was engulfed in powerful dark magics almost overnight. Many are happy that the war is over and that there can be some peace and quiet, although some do not believe the Eldeen Reaches should be considered sovereign.

The festivities are mainly held in Nealford, close to the palace. Nearing the evening, Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn comes out to the balcony overlooking the festivities and delivers a speech commemorating the celebration. Diva sees, out of the corner of her eye, someone wearing a similar necklace to the patron described in House Jorasco a couple of days prior. In the midst of that speech, what looks to be a red glint of light rises in the distance. Red lightning begins to crackle from the glint, and all of a sudden a massive explosion rings out from the King's Rest in Besalle's Ward, and the necrotic energy rising up forms a set of green claws clutching at the red glint before it's pulled back towards the ground. Queen Aurala is quickly ushered to safety as our party members go to investigate the explosion. 

Undead of all kinds litter what was one a bustling marketplace in the Besalle's Ward. In the distance, our adventurers can hear the clamor of civilians attempting to escape and members of the city watch calling out to each other in combat. Gallywix and Alzarif take the western path while Diva and Ana flanked east. Most of the undead were fairly unresponsive and went down without much struggle, almost as if they themselves weren't sure why they were up in the first place. 

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/c/c7/Beholder_zombie-5e.png/revision/latest?cb=20171011164729" alt="Beholder Zombie" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

All the destruction about the marketplace came to a head nearby the King's Rest, where four figures stood holding the very same orb stolen from Ana. A platinum blonde tiefling with curly horns, a dark clothed man bearing a skull face tattoo and a gothic dulcimer, Grexes, and Tak discussed what to do now that the orb had been used in such a brazen fashion. Floating above the fountain in the plaza was a beholder zombie, an aberration of myth seemingly resurrected for nefarious purposes. Diva began to converse with the group to little success, as the tattooed man, Drego Entarro, shrouded them in skeletal dark energy wings before escaping. Soon after, Ana began cursing and ranting on the audacity of them to steal and use the orb in such a manner. The beholder zombie caught wind of that noise, and the fight commenced. 

Gallywix led the fight with several well-placed arrows piercing the eyes on the tendrils of the beholder zombie, while Ana shouted incantations and let off blasts of radiant fire to dispel the creature. Alzarif's eyes turned pale and his complexion dark as he began to attempt rending the mind (or what was left of a mind) from the creature. Diva sent a series of thunderous blasts into the beholder zombie before it attempted to fight back. Although the first ray from the beholder zombie did not amount to much when Ana was hit, Alzarif was not so lucky. The tendrils of the beholder zombie sent orbs of raw magical force into Alzarif's body. One by one, they ravaged him and left him gasping for air before the main eye brought its gaze upon him. A beam of almost nuclear necrotic energy engulfed Alzarif and eroded his being until there was nothing left but his belongings and dust. Alzarif had died to the hands of this beholder zombie. Diva was infuriated at the sight of Alzarif's suffering. She used all of her power to finally break the mind of the beholder zombie before leaving it a spasmic, heaping clump of rot in the plaza. Our heroes had won the day, but at what cost? And what of the orb now in the possession of Grexes and his compatriots?

### Session 5.5 - Downtime Resolution (6 Nov 20)

### Session 5 - A deal with a Devilman (30 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

We find our story beginning this time around in Rordan's Gate. A large open circle of bricks is lined with neat-looking houses. In the middle, a statue of a man in armor is covered with roosting birds. This plaza was dedicated to General Aronne Cestman, a prominent military officer in the middle of the Last War. The plaza itself is well kept and quiet, with the occasional groups of people passing by to get around the ward for the day. Nearby to the statue, we find a figure with a dark brown cloak sitting almost intentionally discretely with their hands covering their face. The shine of silver pokes out at moments when the sun reflects off of the figure's skin… or are they scales?

<img src="https://i.redd.it/xxz8hohep6x31.jpg" alt="Chrom" width="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px">

An enforcer of the monster gang Daask, Chrom the Silver Dragonborn stood watch in protection of a paying client, Klara Cestman of Cestman Arms. He noted that there were some strange hooded figures approaching the shop and ran to investigate. It was really too bad that Chrom forgot it was Hallow's Eve! The poor kids looking for treats were met with an intimidating dragon-man telling them to leave. And leave they did. Klara was disappointed that Daask would intimidate children on a holiday, but figured some candy would sweeten Chrom's mood. Later, Chrom decided to visit Starpeak's Ale House for a quick bite. The restauraunt is one of the few who sell traditional dwarven ale, and has a reputation for some of the best food in the city. Chrom gives some of the candy to a couple of rowdy teens, only to find that they were magical candies. He washes down his sandwich with a fine dwarven ale and enjoys the sights and sounds of the patrons around him. 

Back in the sewers, the rest of the party had just finished beating the daylights out of two crocodiles that had attacked them. As they pushed on into the sewers, they stumbled upon a metal door that Diva yanked down with little effort. The door led into a giant cesspool of muck and gunk littered with various amount of junk. Ana noted there was a ladder-like arrangement of pipes leading up to an overhang. Upon reaching the overhang, the party found some belongings and a note reading ***"They took my daughter, I'll take their lives, the orb is the key"***. Before leaving the cesspool, a stray bear trap caught Ana's leg and dealt some damage, but nothing to permanently injure her. 

Chrom had finished his drink and decided to head home once an ogre tapped him on the shoulder to leave his post. As he was walking closer to Grangehall Ward, he noticed a suspicious dark-robed figure skulking about in the darkness and investigated. The goblin man quickly ran at the sight of the dragonborn, and a chase ensued. Whether it be by luck or by pure skill, Chrom managed to catch the strange goblin and interrogate him on his purpose out in the shadows. The goblin presumed Chrom was a member of the Royal Eyes, and spilled that there was something strange happening in the sewers. Chrom grabbed "Steve" under his arm and had the goblin indicate where they could enter the sewers, sliding down a pipe of sludge into the depths of the city.

Our heroes in the sewers continued on and went through a narrow passageway before being attacked by several giant rats. By the end of the conflict, a single rat remained. This rat would have survived if it was not for the impact our dragonborn friend made upon landing directly on it. Chrom didn't recognize anyone around him, but Gallywix knew Chrom to be a member of Daask almost instantly (considering his illegal substance running for them previously). For some reason, Gallywix feigned recognition of this remarkable dragonborn, and the party agreed to coalesce to figure out what was at the end of this sewer passageway. 

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/756368941022052382/771970770556551178/9f657cf48cb8ebc783cb61d14731eed5.png" alt="The bearded devil" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

At the end of the corridor, a huge room coated in old blood contains a pentagram drawn in chalk with lit candles. A bearded devil sat trapped within this arcane circle, with a shifter man and girl laying at its feet. Ana attempts to cast Spare the Dying on the child, only to find that the life energy she was imbuing into the child was sapping from the man. Be it by the magic containing the devil or otherwise, the shifter man shrivels into a husk. Chrom decides to investigate farther into the room to find several goblin cultists chanting incantations to a crackling red orb. He decides that's too much for him to handle and slowly backs into the previous room before closing the door. Ana and Gallywix make a pact with the bearded devil. Ana requests eldritch power and for the devil to kill the goblins in the next room. Gallywix decides he also wants eldritch power from the devil. The devil happily allows the two to conditionally forfeit their souls before breaking the seal with his new found power, then subsequently burning the cultists in the next room to a fiery crisp. 

The party takes the shifter girl (and "Steve") back to Lurro's Souphouse, where all the shifters in the room are shocked to see Thicket alive and well. Lurro is heartbroken that her sun died "at the hands of goblins" but is glad that Thicket is alive, and that there is a goblin in the room who can be blamed for all of this. Lurro makes a last remark to Diva telling her to take care as a fellow mother. Our heroes take Chrom to the Free Lances Guild Hall in order to register, as he is coincidentally needing some extra money to make ends meet. Jeff is sullied that there are more people that tolerate Gallywix on this planet. 

### Session 4 - Sewer Swimming (23 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

Our party spent some time on their own the following day:

- Gallywix took on some minor work and helped a small shifter girl pull her cat out of a tree. The shifter girl was scared of Gallywix, but was at least willing to pay him for helping her retrieve her pet. He then spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the park in front of the Free Lance's guild hall. 
- Ana visited her favorite bookstore in Fairhaven, Kureon's Oddities, to spend some quiet time reading and picking up a quick spell scroll for later use. The shop is located in the Shadowatch district of the Besalle's Ward, a mostly residential area with some smaller shops littered about.  Kureon Hallorand is a well-educated khoravar particularly knowledgeable about the distant past. He is known to many academics as the city's foremost expert on the War of the Mark, ironically a fact that our faithful Medani foundling does not know. 
- Diva went back to performing at her tavern, the Lady in Blue, located in the Olladra's Gate district of the Besalle's ward. Olladra's Gate is known throughout the city for many famous taverns, and the Lady in Blue is no exception. Magicians and tricksters frequent the tavern and play harmless pranks on eachother when the performers aren't on stage, and the gnomish owner, Jak Lamplighter, is the biggest trickster of the bunch. As Diva completed her performance, her orphans Mayochup, Mayocue, and Kranch all walk in to keep her company and have dinner as the night continued. 

The next morning, Gallywix noticed a gang of shifters making trouble at the Imperia Magewrights in the Free Lances Guild Hall. The two goblins working there, Dobs and Chut, were being harassed as to the whereabouts of a missing child in the Silverclaw pack. Gallywix quickly stepped up and decided nobody was going to harass his kin, and a fight broke out straight away. Ana shortly after she saw the conflict (and Gallywix get a nice claw to the face) and rushed in to support her ally, whipping the leader with necrotic energy to knock him out instantly. As the fight continued, Diva coincidentally sauntered into the guild hall with her breakfast bagel before realizing the mess that was occuring in the shop. It took some well placed strikes and the pleas of Dobs and Chut to stop the conflict, where the party learned that the child was stolen by a goblin in black robes, hence the Silverclaws thinking it was the goblins of the rival Kech Motrai. Their only lead was the information known by Lurro Silverclaw, matron of the pack and owner of the Souphouse 10 minutes down the road. 

<img src="https://dungeonmusings.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/f36d44e074c0d30ef89ee178c160548a.jpg?w=660" alt="Ace Silverclaw" width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px">

Lurro's Souphouse is as busy as it is cozy. The interior of the hall is always steamy, giving it the foggy atmosphere of a jungle, with the sharp tang of spices always hovering in the air. Our heroes found Lurro serving her patrons, and reluctant to give any information, especially to the likes of goblins. Diva quickly saw the look of a distraught mother and persuaded Lurro to talk more on the missing child, and they were brought into the kitchen to speak more. It turns out that both her granddaughter, Thicket, and her son Brahl are missing. Brahl went to go look for Thicket as soon as she disappeared, with no indication of where he went. The shifter gang leader, Ace, slowly regained conciousness before being berated by his 'ma' on his behavior. Ace agreed to take them to where Thicket was last seen.

The location Ace takes them to is... oddly uneventful. A crossroads between alleyways that shows no sign of conflict or struggle. The party decides to investigate further, and although Gallywix found himself face first in a nearby barrell, Diva and Ana sussed out what looked to be an open manhole and decided to jump in. Ace declined to follow them in for one reason or another. 

Our heroes continue into the sewers, coming into contact with repugnant odors and plenty of wall moss before arriving at a tunnel marked with a goblin symbol for 'here.' They decide to hop down and traverse the muck, quickly getting ambushed by two crocodiles that have made their home in the waterways. Ana and Gallywix both were pulled underwater by the crocodile's gaping maws, but they successfully dispatched the creatures before any serious injuries were sustained. 

### Session 3 - "Well, they don't usually tattoo babies..." (16 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

Professor Xendros noted that she was a specialist in the containment of magical energies, and was experimenting with new ways to conjure beasts using 'spell orbs,' hence the reason why the Quori spirit was contained in her bag (now identified as a Bag of Holding.) She also noted her ability to 'procure' items for adventurers from the Archive in the University of Wynarn if the party has the money. Before the party left, Xendros made a note of Ana's 'peculiar mark' on her forehead and pointed Ana in the direction of House Medani for more information. Our adventurers were paid 125gp each and were quickly ushered out of Xendros' office. 

Afterwards, Gallywix stopped by the House Orien post office to send some money to his wife and kids in the mail. He convinced the party to stop by a local 'Catgirl Cafe' ran by only Tabaxi in the Knowledge Ward. All the party members purchased some type of coffee drink before sitting down. Gallywix attempted to pickpocket Ana, and a fight almost broke out between the two in the cafe if it wasn't for their drinks being delivered. While the party was enjoying their beverages, Gallywix decided to "help" an orcish patron win the heart of one of the waitresses, a white-haired Tabaxi by the name of Alicia. Kubrag was quickly brought from fear to anger as Gallywix poured coffee onto him, forcing Kubrag to ake off his shirt in the cafe. Alicia and Kubrag quickly got to talking about a potential date and went off to find Kubrag a shirt. Before leaving, Leon bought Ana a pair of cat ears from the cafe as a souvenir. 

<img alt="Lord Taldor d'Medani of Fairhaven" src="https://i.ibb.co/xXzz5h6/taldor.png" width ="250px" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px;">

The party decided next to stop by the House Medani enclave located in the Chequer's Ward of Fairhaven. Bankers, deliverymen and other types of clerks tend to frequent the district, and the opulent building presented to our adventurers only compounded that relationship House Medani had with the city. An extremely well-built khoravar guarded the door and brought Ana (and only Ana) inside the enclave to meet the Lord of the Enclave, Taldor d'Medani. His gaze was fixed on Ana long before she even entered the room, and Taldor's eccentric mannerisms only further lended to her fear of being knee-deep in unknown territory. He told Ana of the nature of her mark, the Mark of Detection, that brought her power and a birthright to soar above others in the land. Ana didn't really understand most of the eugenics associated with his speech, but Taldor resolved to attempt and find information about this 'foundling' within the next couple of days before quickly showing her out of the enclave. 

Next, our heroes decided to stop by the market in the Besalle's Ward nearby. Gallywix attempted to trade up a crate of tomatoes for some blunts of tobacco while Diva took one of the gems they found against the bandits and had it inlaid in gold with a local jeweler. Leon and Ana decided to hit up a local Sovereign Host temple to make a quick prayer, much to Ana's dismay as a cleric devoted to The Keeper. Leon made a quick prayer to Aureon in order to bless his sword. The acolytes inside were somewhat wary of Ana's presence, but Leon hastily managed to convince them she was here to repent before bolting from the establishment in its entirety. 

Later, our party spent a couple of days idling in and out of the Free Lance's guild hall before Taldor d'Medani set foot with his consort into the hall to find Ana. They noted that they could not find any records of her heritage, and asked for her parent's names. "Ferris and Agnes" was what Ana said before Taldor left her an open invitation to come and reclaim her heritage, if she so wishes. He then promptly left the hall. 

### Session 2 - A Dance with the Inspired (10 Oct 20)
DM: Andres S.

When the party woke up after being attacked by Needle Blights the previous evening, Gallywix was intent on making the team some breakfast. He actually managed to find some bird eggs and mushrooms to make a decent omelette. Ana and Leon both decided to help by finding herbs and tomatoes respectively, however only Ana found anything worthwhile in the outcroping. Once breakfast was over, the party set out to the presumed location of the bandits. 

Our adventurers came to the clearing in the cover of night. Although not everyone was well versed in stealth, our party managed to make their way to the center of the camp with minimum issues and a large "glizzy" in Leon's bag. Conflict ensued when Ana stealth-bonked one of the bandits in the head as Leon impaled another with his javelins. Gallywix was knocked out mid-combat and sustained a nasty scar trailing from his left cheekbone down his neck to his right shoulder. The bandit captain, in possession of the bag, attempted to open it to hopefully find a weapon or item strong enough to deter the attackers. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a Quori spirit ensnared in the bag's magics, and quickly the bandit captain was forced to be an Inspired puppet, summoning crysteel daggers to make quick work of our heroes. Luckily between Ana's necrotic power and Diva's quick swordplay, the possessed captain was killed and the spirit flew away into the night. 

As the party made it back to the Guild Hall, "Jeff" provided our heroes with another note from a KX detailing where to bring the bag. The originator of the quest has actually been a professor at the University of Wynarn on the opposite side of town. Gallywix charged into the professor's office to be greeted by a motherly looking tiefling by the name of Kallista Xendros.

### Session 1 - Secure the Bag (25 Sep 20)
DM: Andres S.

Our adventurers began their story in the Free Lances' Guild Hall, located in the Grangehall Ward of Fairhaven in the country of Aundair. We found two of our party members, Gallywix and Diva, having a casual old discussion in the common area before noticing Alzarif staring at them from another table. Gallywix decides to stop by the Questmaster, "Jeff", for the newest quests. Not many catch the team's eyes except for one hastily written paper that just requests that a bag be recovered for 500gp from a group of bandits. Unfortunately there was not much more information to go off of, until Ana, a cleric in the guild, came over and read the paper using her Mark of Detection. Invisible ink detailed the location by which the bandits had presumably riden to, and the party was ready to head out. That is, until "Jeff" pointed out the fact that they had no muscle. Between a Bard, Cleric, Rogue, and Sorcerer, it was clear that there needed to be a tank of sorts in order to balance out their team against potential assailants. After a quick call around the room for help, a Paladin by the name of Leon rose from his table and decided to help our adventurers. 

As they traveled north-west from Fairhaven, our party made their way through farmland. Many farmers in such a magically advanced country like Aundair tend to utilize their knowledge of artifice to their benefit. Leon was the only one bewildered by this fact, stunned at the sight of floating farm equipment being a casual occurance in the countryside. The party found their way to an outcropping midway between their presumed location and set up camp. In the night during one of their watches, several Needle Blights came out of the trees and attacked our party. No serious injuries occured, besides Diva casting Thunderclap to destroy two of the creatures outright. The rest of the night was uneventful as the party finished their long rest before setting out the next day on the road again.
