A number of these items can be used to craft weapons / armor with unique effects. 
The effect gained from the crafted item will be indicated by '**ARMOR**:' or '**WEAPON:**' in the effect description. 
For example, effects with **WEAPON (RANGED)**: have a restriction where only ranged weapons will be able to use the effect.
