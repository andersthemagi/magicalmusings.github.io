**NOTE:** Pictures and information currently being updated for current Bot functionality.

The Traveler (or Sovereign of Chaos) is a Discord bot utilized in order to manage D&D-related tasks and perform minor functions supporting Game Mastering for Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition. 

Features currently include:
- **Dice Rolls:** Using the d20 package for Python, a custom dice roll interpreter is available for users to type in the roll they want, and the Traveler will provide!
- **Initiative Tracker:** The Traveler allows DMs to grab initiative for combat without needing to worry about everyone yelling it at the same time. Upon initialization, the Traveler listens for every valid creature input on the channel until the DM determines the order is complete.
- **Magic Item Rolls:** Players (or users) can use the Traveler to determine a random magical item. When rolling, rarity can be set for the following settings currently:
  - ***Uncommon (UC).***
  - ***Rare (R).***
  - ***Very Rare (VR).***
- **Other Functionality**:
  - **Advice.** Essentially an 8-ball, you ask the Traveler a question and he will do his best to answer.

The Traveler is written in Python utilzing the Discord.py wrapper. The bot is sustained using Flask on Repl.it with regular pings coming from Uptime Robot to prevent inactivity. You can see the source code for The Traveler on <a href="https://github.com/magicalmusings/xendros-bot">Github</a>.
