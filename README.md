A simple blog-style website to detail ramblings on Dungeons and Dragon's 5th Edition. You can see the live site at [https://magicalmusings.github.io/](https://magicalmusings.github.io/).

## Pull Requests and Contributions

Happy [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!! 

Feedback and contributions are more than welcome on this project! All contributors are expected to be following the [Contributor Covenant.](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) You can find information on what that entails in the ```code_of_conduct.md``` file located in the main directory. 

In general, I follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow. 

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Commit changes to your own branch
4. Push your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

### Building the Website on Local Machines 

See the [Jekyll Quick Start](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) guide for more detailed steps on how to build sites locally. 

#### Instructions 

1. Install all [prerequisites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Install the jekyll and bundler [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems)

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Build the site in the main directory and make it available on a local server. The ```--livereload``` option makes it so Jekyll automatically refreshes the page with each change you make to the source files.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

4. Navigate to [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000)

It's that simple! If you encounter any errors during this process, check that you have installed all the prerequisites in [Requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements). If you still have issues, see [Troubleshooting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems).

## Issues / Feature Requests

In the event you find any bugs / typos, or want to suggest adding information or content to the site, feel free to open up an issue on [the Issue Tracker](https://github.com/magicalmusings/magicalmusings.github.io/issues) detailing everything you want me to know. ***For my D&D Players, there may be in-game incentive on the line if you help me out this way!!***
