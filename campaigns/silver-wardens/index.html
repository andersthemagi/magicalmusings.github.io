<h3 id="session-2---do-dd-characters-pay-child-support-17-nov-19">Session 2 - “Do D&amp;D characters pay child support?” (17 Nov 19)</h3>

<p><strong>[1377 LY]</strong> After collecting the heads of Dazlyn Greyshard and Norbus Ironrune at the Ruins of Nirolduhr, our party triumphantly headed back to Eldur’s Rest to collect their bounty of 1000 silver. Tomm Rona, townmaster of Eldur’s Rest, didn’t fully expect anyone to actually kill the two dwarves, and yet here we were. Rona reluctantly gave the party their reward, and the money was split four ways with Adabra.</p>

<p>From there the party decided to do some shopping and dropping. Nekarog went and fought a patron at the Stonehill Inn that caused him to be thrown out onto the street by Toblen, the Inn’s proprietor. Faelyn traded in his newly found gemstones for an amount of money that would make Grendel jealous, while Grendel himself perused the Lionshield Coster of Eldur’s Rest for possible new weapons and armor. Adabra quickly rounded up the party the next day to assist in the hunting of a dragon for a total of three silver bars (approx. 3000 silver), and our adventurers sauntered on into the Neverwinter Wood to dispatch the dragon menace.</p>

<p>Along the way, the party visited the charred remains of their encounter with the lightning boar and found some leftover items for their troubles. Soon enough they arrived in Castle Elsir, a long abandoned human castle left in Neverwinter Wood that has since been occupied by various goblins, hobgoblins and other woodland creatures. In traditional D&amp;D fashion, the party cleared the castle with minimal encounters to arrive at the feet of a very large Faerie Dragon. Where most people would try to either soothe or kill such a beast, Grendel had other plans. Our halfling friend decided his best move was to “entertain” the dragon and flew off with it to make weird halfling-dragonborn bastard children. The saner members of the party took the time to finish ridding the castle of hostiles claiming Castle Elsir as their own for the time being.</p>

<p>Nekarog and Faelyn agreed to ask Adabra to look after the castle while they went to collect their bounty. Little did they know about what was waiting for them in Eldur’s Rest. The very same Petty Officer Smithson that our adventurers left comatose in a dwarven cairn reported the issue up to his superiors, and the Adrestian Empire came back in full force. Led by Sergeant First Class Dernes Ravanath of the Ghost Marines, spirits of ice and privates alike ravaged the small mountain town. It was a bit of a struggle to get through towards the Shrine of Luck, but our party down two made do. Grendel finally decided to show up riding his now baby momma, Marmilyth, who decimated the invading squads and kept them at bay as the party dealt with the main threat: SFC Ravanath. Ravanath proved to be an extremely adept fighter as he downed two of our party members before being struck down by Nekarog. Now attuned to the Ghost Marine’s trident, Nekarog quickly dispatched the rest of the empire’s troops holding up by the Townmaster’s Hall. The Empi re s Attack on Eldur s Rest was thwarted.</p>

<p><strong>[1378 LY: Six Months Later…]</strong> The people of Eldur’s Rest decided to reward Faelyn, Nekarog and Grendel by assisting them with the revitalization efforts of Castle Elsir, which was now to be renamed “Castle Hank.” Walls were rebuilt and reinforced, as well as personnel brought on to assist in the general upkeep of the establishment. Faelyn took the time to ensure these repairs went smoothly and to his extremely high standards. Meanwhile during the six months, Nekarog returned to bounty hunting and has made a small name for himself in the profession. Nobody in and around Eldur’s Rest dares to step out of line, lest “Eldur’s Trident” come knocking. Grendel maintained spotty yet amicable relations with Marmiryth, with no real control of her actions (she’s very much a strong independent faerie dragon that don’t need no halfling). The people of Eldur’s
Rest took the encounter with the Empire as a wake up call, spreading the word far and wide that the town is a bastion for neutrality on the continent of G’Zira. Settlers have been coming and quickly expanding Eldur’s Rest, enough that Tomm Rona has assembled a shoddy guard to keep the peace.</p>

<p>We find our party returning after this six month period to be reunited by the dwarven cleric Adabra, who was summoned along with the three adventurers to the Townmaster’s Hall. A large, cloaked figure sits at the table with Tomm Rona.</p>

<h3 id="session-1---boars-mastiffs-and-jellies-oh-my-11-nov-19">Session 1 - Boars, Mastiffs, and Jellies: Oh My!! (11 Nov 19)</h3>

<p>Nekarog, a former bounty hunter and now convicted criminal, wakes to find himself onboard a prison cart on the way to Neverwinter. In an effort to rile his compatriots, Nekarog begins to kick around and scream inside the cart. Grendel Brooker, a halfling hailing from the slum houses of Neverwinter, and Faelyn Valsys, a high elf Lonoan Afficionado, also begin to flail and scream. Everyone in the cart is screaming like crazy pigs. Speaking of pigs: A giant boar draped in lightning attacks the cart and makes mince meat out of the Adrestian guards and horses. The party attempts to fight this boar to no avail, and everything goes dark.</p>

<p>After what seemed to be a total party kill, Faelyn and the party wake up to being tended by a cleric in her domicile. The cleric introduces herself as Adabra Gwynn, a disciple of Palma and a local master of herbs and healing products. Word of this renowned ability was somehow noted to the Adrestian Empire, indicated by Petty Officer Smithson and his two Privates coming to her windmill with orders to “requisition” her aid. Adrestia’s other option provided is to raze the windmill to the ground and take her by force. Nekarog manages to convince the Petty Officer to sit down and talk this issue out, while Adabra brings the party what looks to be ale. The Petty Officer most definitely did not drink ale. As they finish off his Private attendants, the party buries the Petty Officer in a dwarven cairn, leaving him to his presumable death. Adabra urges the party to leave her windmill, seeing as now it is unsafe from the Empire’s grasp.</p>

<p>The party after two days of travel arrives in Eldur’s Rest, a small mining town in the rocky hills home to a number of merchants and artisans. Eldur’s Rest can be considered neutral in terms of allegiance to Adrestia. Grendel decides to peddle off assorted baubles to Barthen of Barthen’s Provisions, Nekarog manages to steal 50 silver off of Toblen Stonehill in his local inn / tavern, and Faelyn makes a small prayer to the local Shrine of Luck dedicated to Eldur. Lono, god of music, peace, and the arts hears Faelyns prayer and provides him guidance and blessing in the form of a goose. The party decides to name the goose Hank. After their excursions, the party catches up with Adabra at the Townmaster’s Hall, meet the Townmaster (Tomm Rona), and are given a bounty to collect on two Adrestian nobles performing an excavation in the Sword Mountains. 500 silver EACH for the heads of Dazlyn Grayshard and Norbus Ironrune. It was an offer the party was not keen to refuse.</p>

<p>During their travels the party stumbles upon a group of orcs hunting in the hills. Nekarog manages to convince these orcs in their native tongue to assist them in completing this bounty, with the promise of over 100 silver per person. With no money to their name, the orcs reluctantly accept.</p>

<p>Grendel and his allies stumble across the Adrestian excavation in a long abandoned dwarven settlement. With some effort they manage to persuade the two privates standing guard that they are here to meet Dazlyn and Norbus and enter the ruins. A quick encounter with some ochre jellies rendered the party slightly frazzled, meanwhile Faelyn happened upon a decent amount of gemstones to sell. These gemstones paled in comparison to the loot that Grendel found with Adabra, as Grendel found a massive emerald in the possession of a greedy demonic looking statue. Obviously the statue was a trap, but Grendel didn’t care. After almost dying, the temple began to rupture and the party made it out alive of the ruins. Waiting for them outside the ruins were their targets.</p>

<p>Dazlyn and Norbus proved to be decent (yet not challenging) foes to our adventurers. With the assistance of the orcs, both of our dwarves’ head were cleaved right off and the quest was presumed completed. Things weren’t exactly finished from what the party could tell. As Nekarog quietly mentioned the betrayal of the orcs, the orcs decided to take advantage of the situation and betray the party. Adabra was brought close to death during the combat, however the party made it out of the surprise attack alive.</p>

<p>With the heads of Dazlyn, Norbus, and the orcs that betrayed them, our adventurers head back to Eldur’s Rest to collect their reward from Tomm Rona.</p>
