<p><strong>Setting:</strong> Ka’athun (Homebrew)</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>A ragtag group of adventurers are “conscripted” by the extended authority of the Lunar Empress of Adrestia by a local folk hero to spread the empire’s influence in neighboring continents. What were once tumultous allies became hostile, as our party quickly finds themselves in far over their heads and split between helping the Duchess of Saltmarsh or razing her fair city to the ground. Their endeavors paved the way for a organized resistance on the continent of G’Zira against the empire, led by former Inquisitor Rosani “Agenna” Valsys.</p>

<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>

<p>Janus dedicated themselves to the craft of whaling at the end of the day, and was darn near good at it too. Within several months they had developed enough clout to become a semi-wealthy and prominent guild leader in Lunalis. They, alongside Rosani and her “resistance,” continue to provide those against the empire key intelligence, disguised as “Ariel” within lower noble circles. Ariel grew to be a divergent yet equally powerful persona for Janus, and their combined spell prowess only grew with more education and training.</p>

<p>Grendel moved along to become a part of <a href="https://magicalmusings.github.io/one-shots/wendys/"> the Silver Wardens </a>, accompanying the late Valsys heir and the Red Trident on a conquest to unite the Horn of G’Zira. He still lives happily between excursions with his Faerie Dragon wife and several half-dragon-halfling children.</p>

<p>Grungo? Well, he’s still the same old frog as usual. Citizens of Saltmarsh may occasionally find him outside, soaking in a barrel of mead for the day. When he’s not lounging, Grungo can be found to frequent fight pits and collosseums around the coastline. His goal is to one day become as good as Adonis, Master Gladiator of Palaestra.</p>

<p>Praeron disappeared about as quickly as he came into the lives of the rest of the party. Tavern goers in Saltmarsh spoke kindly of the crackshot half-elf who brought down the stronghold of Krundukar, and word quickly spread about his earlier involvement with the escape of the Silver Wardens from the orcish prison island. No matter how many wanted posters were up for Praeron, no bounty was ever collected on him. Perhaps some day the folk hero may turn up again.</p>

<h3 id="session-6---the-wendys-one-shot-8-dec-19">Session 6 - The Wendy’s One Shot (8 Dec 19)</h3>

<p>See the <a href="https://magicalmusings.github.io/one-shots/wendys/"> Wendy’s One Shot page </a> for more unfortunate details.</p>

<h3 id="session-5---do-we-have-a-name-yet-24-nov-19">Session 5 - “Do we have a name yet?” (24 Nov 19)</h3>

<p>Imagine, just for a moment, that our party members were ill-prepared to face off against four Ghost Marines and the rest of the hordes of Adrestian military hiding out in Khrundukar. You could consider a Total Party Kill (TPK) an alternate timeline, because this time? Our adventurers had this fight decently enough in the bag of holding. Although a bit tedious, our party members successfully got through their enemy with some minor issues.</p>

<p>Eventually, the party came upon a small room containing a Mage of the Lunar Court known as Tarael. The Lunar Court is a circle of magi directly commanded by the Empress of Adrestia, Theodora Minervalis IX, to assist in the carrying out of her most direct will, whether that be diplomatically or by providing key magical support for military endeavors. In this case, Tarael was performing the latter of her duties. If only, IF ONLY, our party members had any inkling of mercy, they might have been able to see just how intense a fight with a Lunar Court mage could have been. Grungo threw his Portable Hole and Frederico managed to push Tarael in, from there you can presume that Tarael was suffocated and murdered most expeditiously. From there the party continued on and determined Khrundukar to be secure (at the very least, the Adrestian threats in the area had been cleared), so they headed back to Saltmarsh to do what they do best: throw money at a tiefling for free stuff.</p>

<p>The duchess of Saltmarsh gave the party six silver bars in return for their service in both clearing Khrundukar and rescuing the two tiefling agents from the Whispers of Ishtar. All was quiet for a while on the western front. In the span of two weeks, the party paid Captain Xendros to not only procure them additional artifacts, but to teach Frederico the ways of the Warlock. For a silver bar, who could refuse? After the couple of weeks passed, Frederico had successfully made a pact with the Goddess of Love, the Lunar Wave Ishtar. Not to be confused with the Goddess of War, the Solar Flare Ishtar. Two VERY different deities.</p>

<p>During our heroes’ brief intermission, news had come via messenger about disaster and tragedy back in the empire’s capitol of Lunalis. A group of gnomish raiders had flown in airships and bombed a good portion of the Adrestian Empire’s greatest treasure in the dead of night, leaving dead civilians, disrupted trade guilds, and overall disarray for the empire to contend with. Theodora IX had little to say beyond her purest rage, mandating the culling of all gnomes within her borders as well as the shift in focus from expansion of influence to full-blown conquest. In the coming months, Adrestia has publicly announced the sending of their Armada far through the southern seas to find and eliminate all involved in the attack.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Saltmarsh, the Duchess brought the parties attention to the Adrestian Empire’s increased effort, communicating a worry about whether Saltmarsh was going to be able to handle an attack in its current condition. There is only so much Eda can do on her end to help. She tells the party of two cities that could help in bringing together a coalition of forces and resources to defend against Adresti. The first of these allies would be the city of Yartar, merchant guild central, stronghold, and gateway to the leeward side of G’Zira. Currently Yartar is experiencing a minor civil war, with all manners of guilds protesting the increasing taxes and brutality of the Yartaran Lions, the “private military guild” that keeps the city safe. Once through the Sword Mountains, the seemingly endless deserts beyond give way to a grand oasis kingdom known as Tal-Shasit that could provide Saltmarsh with various forms of assistance, either in manpower, materials, or even magical defenses. Our parties’ mission was clear: it was time to go beyond the Sword Mountains.</p>

<p>In other news: backstory episodes for Frederico, Grungo, and Adabra will follow.</p>

<h3 id="session-4---raiding-khrundukar-17-nov-19">Session 4 - Raiding Khrundukar (17 Nov 19)</h3>

<p>A hidden cave in an Alchemist’s Estate. Orders from the Adrestian Empire to raze Saltmarsh. Decisions to make. Rosanhi Agenna Valsys had much to ponder on after the raid she orchestrated in conjunction with our party. On one hand as an Inquisitor of the Black Crescent, she had to follow what the Empress, Theodora IX, desired. On the other, she couldn’t stand to see such another beautiful town like Saltmarsh be burnt to the ground. Not again. No one else needs to burn. She and the party raced out of the cavern via a stolen dinghy and headed back to town to report this news to the Duchess of Saltmarsh, Eda Oweland.</p>

<p>In a brief and well-needed intermission, our party successively found and spent all their newly found silver in the Quartermaster’s of Ishtar magic shop in Saltmarsh, a location chock full of magical artifacts and a most curious Tiefling woman. Captain Xendros made a killing off Praeron and his compatriots as she procured for them magical items to aid them in their adventures. To say that our daring heroes were plenty ready for the trials and tribulations to come was an understatement. The next day, Rosanhi led the party to visit the Duchess’ Estate in Saltmarsh, where Praeron decided he was going to get drunk off of a cup of the strongest dwarven brandy the Duchess’ gnome attendant could find, bottled in 1007. Upon being notified of the plot to attack Saltmarsh, Eda contacted her associates from the Whispers of Ishtar to compile reconnaissance and intelligence from the past couple of months with Rosanhi. All the troop movements were clear: Adrestia was prepping for an assault from Khrundukar, a long contested dwarven fortress in Stone Tooth Mountain.</p>

<p>The party made a quick stop in the village of Burle to find that it too had been razed to the ground by the Adrestian Empire. Rotting corpses, large icicle shards, and burned houses littered what used to be a beautiful farming town before the Silverstrand Forest. What remained came as a shock. Literally. Shadows, Specters and Will-o-Wisps attacked our party, leaving Adabra with a nasty necrotic scar on her face reaching down towards her shoulders.</p>

<p>Before reaching the base of Stone Tooth Mountain, the party were distantly greeted by wood elves of the Silverstrand Forest. At the very least, the Empire hadn’t dared disturb the evergreen peace of the sylvan creatures. As the party arrived, Praeron recommended that the party sit in wait for a group of scouts to ambush. Much to their surprise the ambush was successful, consisting of Grungo throwing a Ghost Marine into a Portable Hole, Rosanhi interrogating a poor scout, and the eventual slitting of the same scout’s throat by Grendel. Oddly enough Grungo took the Ghost Marine’s armor and decided to wear it under his cloak. Their own scouting efforts led to a non-descript chimney a distance away from the main entrance of Khrundukar which our adventurers used as their way in. After a short while, Janus found two tieflings, Geradil Ralxik and Courana Madani, from the Whispers of Ishtar locked away in a cell. Each member of the party attempted in their own unique way to open the door until Janus finally managed, followed by Praeron throwing Janus in the cell and locking the door again.</p>

<p>Once everyone got to the correct side of the cell wall, the challenge of clearing the stronghold of Khrundukar began. Where would they start? Would they be able to handle the elite soldiers within? Why do they still have an extremely rickety bridge in the middle of their base? All of these questions were quickly answered with the party getting shot at by Ghost Marines in an attempt to cross an rotting old wooden rope bridge. Grungo, in his Ghost Marine armor, managed to convince the enemy in the room to throw themselves off the cliff with his rank. Apparently Grung can serve in the Marines. The party went on to sabotage Adrestia’s artillery emplacements in the ramparts of
Khrundukar, continuing to explore deeper in the stronghold.</p>

<h3 id="session-3---the-hunted-house-10-nov-19">Session 3 - The Hunted House (10 Nov 19)</h3>

<p>Agenna, Inquisitor of the Black Crescent, wishes to enlist the aid of Praeron’s Marine Expeditionaries to assist her in clearing out a site with possible Whispers of Ishtar Agents from Ebrus hiding there. She gives the party one day to prepare before the raid on the house. The party aptly uses this time to buy maps, explore Saltmarsh, and eat dirt outside the Snapping Line. Once assembled, Agenna leads the party down south in the dead of night to take care of these suspected agents.</p>

<p>The house itself used to be owned by a renowned alchemist, the name of which has been lost to time. Now decrepit, the house is home to a great many hazards, to which Janus especially learns an equally great deal about. The party splits in the main entry hall to clear more room in the house. While Grungo, Praeron and Frederico find a number of high value loot items, Janus, Agenna, and Grendel stumble upon a bound dwarf. Her name is Adabra Gwynn, a Palman Cleric, that seems to have a history with Grendel. She threatens to kill him on the pretenses of betrayal, that of which Grendel is not privy to go into detail. The party decides to bring her along, and she proves useful as a healer where applicable.</p>

<p>Grungo’s team finds a trapdoor that leads to the cellar filled with bandits, while Janus’ party manages to arrive from a separate doorway after taking care of centipedes in the kitchen. Much fighting ensues, especially against several spooky scary skeletons and a particular skeleton alchemist. Praeron loots the bag from the alchemist as well a philosopher’s stone that can supposedly turn base metal to gold. Grungo finds an erotic novel, fully illustrated. The party ventures into the caverns via a secret door to uncover a number of smuggled goods.</p>

<p>Exploring the caverns led the party to meet with an Ensign First Class Sanbalet of the Adrestian Marines. He and his band of misfits were fully intent on killing the party based on the fact that Inquisitor Agenna was with them. Although tumultuous, the party persevered and killed Sanbalet’s minions. Agenna left Sanbalet alive, and found orders stating that Saltmarsh was to be razed to the ground, that she was responsible for making it easier for Adrestia, and that a man known as “High Tower” was ready to assault the town via amphibious means. Agenna did not take this news well. It took a good amount of convincing from the party for her to determine that her purpose was more than the Empire, and that Saltmarsh was indeed a town worth saving.</p>

<p>The party has gained a number of boons on this excursion, including several bolts of cloth and casks of brandy left behind by the now dead smugglers (who we can presume to be mercenaries for Adrestia, not any agents of the Whispers.) They took advantage of a beached supply ship in the cave, loaded their loot, and sailed off.</p>

<h3 id="session-2---an-insurgent-encounter-31-oct-19">Session 2 - An Insurgent Encounter (31 Oct 19)</h3>

<p>The party arrived in Neverwinter after a slightly bumpy ride from Lunalis. After insulting the captain, they were quickly ushered off the boat to complete their objective of reaching the expeditionary brigade HQ to assist in expansion efforts of Adrestian influence. Praeron went ahead and met with Lt. Cmdr Stevenson while the rest of the party explored the bustling colony. At some point Grungo smacked the administrative assistant in the forehead with his tongue in an attempt to eat a fly. Grendel rolled for sex and Janus had himself exactly two ales, meanwhile Grungo took the time to fish and caught a carp.</p>

<p>Praeron was given three tasks to complete by the end of the month. First of which was to assist in converting the neutral town of Saltmarsh into an ally for Adrestia, which will provide key economic and strategic benefits for the empire. Second was to rid Conyberry’s Butterskull Ranch  of bandit raiders and bring Alfonse (Big Al) back as hopefully an emmissary for the empire. Third was to dispatch a number of orcish pirate ships out off the coast of Neverwinter that have been terrorizing merchant ships (and seemingly had thunderstorms on their side, so that’s neato).</p>

<p>The party decided unanimously to go assist Saltmarsh first, leaving the other two tasks to travel down south. Along the way, Janus was lucky enough to be visited by… A white goose. Praeron killed said goose and kept it’s skull on his belt. The following morning the goose returned and the party decided it wasn’t worth trying to kill it a second time, and lovingly named the goose Frederico. Later that day, Praeron decided to throw a rock into the water and disturbed four crocodiles that attacked our adventurers. No casualties, but both Praeron and Janus were bit up decently bad.
Our heroes during this time decided that it was their best option to follow Frederico, not knowing whether the goose had any idea where he was going. Later in the travel to Saltmarsh, the party was ambushed by 12 kobolds that inhabited the Hool Marshes and were close to being attacked. Grendel wasn’t particularly adept in Draconic, but managed to negotiate and translate for Praeron for safe passage through the kobolds lands for the price of 5 silver pieces. From there the party managed to arrive in Saltmarsh decently unscathed.</p>

<p>Once in the town, Praeron referenced back to the tasks given and noted that they were to meet a certain Black Crescent inquisitor by the name of ‘Redline.’ It didn’t take long to find Redline as the party noted a darkly clothed figure with a weird hat and silver mask, with a crescent and pegasus amulet beating the everlasting shit out of a tiefling. After explaining their purpose, Redline led the adventurers to the Black Crescent’s base of operations in Saltmarsh and ushered them into a secret room in an abandoned house on the outskirts of town.</p>

<p>As the party entered, Redline took off her mask and cover to introduce herself as Inquisitor Agenna, a red-headed high elf that rolled high on hotness.  Once her apprentices arrived, she explained the situation in Saltmarsh from the Black Crescent’s perspective. The tiefling city-state of Ebrus has been working tirelessly through their agents, the Whispers of Ishtar, to do the opposite and align Saltmarsh with the beliefs of Ishtar and Thanatos rather than Lunala. This is not something the Black Crescent are keen to and they wish to take advantage on Ebrus by eliminating all Whispers from the town. Should the Whispers succeed, the town will be difficult to convert back, and Adrestia loses the strategic and economic benefits of allying with the duke of Saltmarsh. To those ends, Agenna has planned a raid on a suspected Whisper hideout in a “haunted house” down the cliffside from Saltmarsh the following evening. For the time being the party was given liberty to explore and rest.</p>

<p>Grungo began to eat dirt outside the Snapped Line, a nautical themed tavern by the docks. Grendel took the time to swindel several sailors in the tavern and secured himself a decent bag of 15 silver. Praeron decided to find a map of the surrounding area, visited a slightly distressed gnomish carpenter, and arrived in the Green Market, where a half-orc agreed to sell him a hastily drawn map for 7 silver. Janus soon followed to simply explore and take in the sites of Saltmarsh with Frederico in tow, affectionately honking at Janus all the while.</p>

<h3 id="session-1---to-gzira-20-oct-19">Session 1 - To G’Zira! (20 Oct 19)</h3>

<p>Praeron Zimmerman von Dostoevski <Brett> was drafted by the Adrestian Empire to serve as a Petty Officer for the Lunalis Royal Marine Regiment at the capital city. Praeron is considered a demi-god by the people of his humble country bumpkin village, Leyellan, and that carries over into everything he does. This reverence brought the interest of the Marines to train him up to his current rank and have him assist in key endeavors for the local regiment. Praeron was tasked by the Regimental Commander, Admiral Rolemahn to assemble a squad to assist in the "cultural expansion" of Adrestia in the far-off continent of G'zira.</Brett></p>

<p>After a tumultuous day of processing applicants, Petty Officer von Dostoevski happened upon two particular individuals that caught his eye. Janus Lahlorath <Chrispy>, an enthusiastic 17-year half-triton private already enlisted with Adrestia's Marines, was the first to show up to the interviews and was readily accepted. The second of these personnel was... not exactly a person. Grungo <Christian>, a frog-looking humanoid, stole the show for Praeron as he displayed his dexterity and expertise with explosives, smacking and blinding a nearby marine in the warehouse.  What more can you ask from a poisonous frog?</Christian></Chrispy></p>

<p>A week passes and the party met up in the 8th solar hour to prepare for their voyage to G’Zira, oddly missing Grungo. They meet the final member of their crew, Grendel Brooker <Ahmir>, a halfling with a knack for the banjo and an unusual obsession with currency. The captain of the merchant ship the party had requisitioned requested that they find their missing frog. After approximately 7 hours, the party gave up and stopped into a local tavern by the docks known as "The Tricky Starfish." Grungo was taking a bath in a stopped up basin behind the bar. The party had their drinks, peddled off faulty weaponry, and stumbled their way back to the ship with a fuming captain waiting on them.</Ahmir></p>

<p>Typically the voyage between Adrestia and G’Zira takes 2-3 weeks depending on the tides and the wind. Luckily the party was blessed with a quick voyage, but not without consequence. Each of the party members were required to assist in the morning, afternoon, and night watches aboard the ship. It wasn’t until around the 9th day of voyage that both Grendel and Janus noticed something off with the sailing speed of their vessel. Janus dove into the water to investigate and found that four Skum had been slowly cultivating an almost arcane mass of seaweed to stop the ship and raid it in the dead of night. Combat ensued. Janus struck two of the Skum with a thunderous clap, alerting the party and the captain to the impending danger. All of the Skum took to the deck of the ship to combat the members of the party. “This is the time, we have no other chance!” bellowed one of the fish creatures in Primordial. The party successfully took down the Skum with no major injuries, and the rest of the voyage went without a hitch. *Let it be known that at some point Praeron cut off one of the Skum’s heads and proceeded to teabag the back of Grungo’s head</p>

<p>The party woke up on the 15th day of travel to see the tropical coast of G’zira, with the bustling new colony of Neverwinter calling their name.  Sails were raised, anchors dropped, ropes secured, and the gangplank of the ship hit the docks.</p>
